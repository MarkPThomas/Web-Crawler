route_description: Tight hands in a corner with 1 and 2 camalots to a bulge where it widens a little to 3 camalot. There is a small flare at the top that may take a 4 camalot if you want, and then you're at the anchor. The name of this climb is due to the fact that an owl lives in the cave at the top.
