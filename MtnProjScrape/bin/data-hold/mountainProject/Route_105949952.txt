route_description:  Easy moves up an initial blocky section lead to the long hands to fist/rattly fist crack that makes up the bulk of this route.  Two distinct cruxes in this crack.  From the stance at the top of the crack, a final, unexpected challenge makes you commit to earn the nicely situated anchors 15 ft higher.
