area_url: /v/08---bishop-pass-and-evolution/110819748 
description: Peaks north of Bishop Pass, and south of Piute Pass form two basic groups, Bishop Group and Evolution Group. While there are no 14,000 ft peaks in these groups the peak are high and majestic.  The Bishop Group is accessible from the South Lake Trailhead, either to Treasure Lakes, or Bishop Pass. There are many popular campsites along both of these trails. Cross country travel is possible from the Treasure Lakes Trail to the Bishop Pass Trail. Both trails are short and easy. As stated this is a very popular area.  The Evolution Group is accessible from the trailhead at Lake Sabrina, which splits at Blue Lake to take you to either Mount Thompson (left) or (right) Mount Darwin, etc. The trails are a little longer but still reasonably moderate. The right branch also splits heading (left) either to Hungry Packer Lake for Picture Perfect Peak, Mount Haeckel, or over Alpine Col. or (right) to Mount Darwin and Blue Heaven Lake.  The north faces of Mounts Darwin and Mendel are accessible via Lamarck Col, which follows the Lamarck Lake Trail from North Lake, the heads south and west from there over the main crest - an excellent way into Darwin Canyon.  The west side of the Evolution Group can also be reached from Florence Lake, via a ferry and an extremely scenic hike south through Evolution Valley, this is a long approach. 
getting_there: South Lake and Lake Sabrina Both South Lake and Lake Sabrina are accessible from Hwy 168, which heads west out of Bishop. There's a ranger station (White Mountain) in Bishop which is a good location to pick up your permit the night before. The South Lake Road splits off left before the small community of Aspendell. Parking at both of these trailheads is tight, especially South Lake as Bishop Pass is very popular.  The South Lake trailhead serves two destinations, one to Bishop Pass and the other splits off right after about a mile and takes you to Treasure Lakes - which has to have the highest ratio in the Sierra for short hike/beautiful spot.  North Lake The North Lake Trailhead splits off right, after passing through Aspendell. Plenty of parking usually at North Lake - although Piute Pass is also very popular in the summer months. Mentioned here because it is the trailhead for Lamarck Col.  Permits  For the eastern approaches are available here.
