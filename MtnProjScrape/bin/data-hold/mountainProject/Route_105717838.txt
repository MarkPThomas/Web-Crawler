route_description: Get to the North Face of Bubo Tower from Balanced Rock as described on the "Rock Page."  There is one feature on this face... a yawning chimney that splits it.    Climb up a soft slab for perhaps 10-20 feet, I don't recall exactly how high... and enter the chimney.    I slowly picked my way up this, first more or less squeezing, then with my back on one side and feet on the other, then finally in a near-splits, which was slow-going.  Much to my surprise, my partner followed at great speed as he got to the top- with hands on one side and feet on the other- walking up that way.  Of course, placing gear like this would be no fun.  The route was originally 3 pitches.  Given the little amount of gear and shortness of the climb, doing it in a single pitch as we did seemed much better.    Rap from anchors on the top via 2 ropes (50M will do). A single 70M might get you down. The condition of the webbing on the anchors up top is unknown. It was total crap when I did the climb and I replaced them, but that has been 7 years of desert sun and wind atop a tower.    As always when doing towers, take some new red/brown webbing just in case.
