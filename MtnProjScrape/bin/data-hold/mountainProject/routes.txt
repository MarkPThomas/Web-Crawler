route_description: This route combines Grant's Crack with the 5.6 chimney above the small belay tree. If you know the name of the route, please leave it in the comments so they I may update it.  Climb Grant's crack or Oak Tree Flake to the belay tree. Second pitch is 5.6-7 depending on where you go, but it's all laid back. Continue up above chimney and slightly right. If you have a 70m rope, you can belay from the large ledge next to the walk off for Swan Slab Gully's 3rd pitch. 60m brings you to a slightly awkward belay on some dirt and grass mounds with large flakes.  There is an old rusted bolt atop the 5.6 chimney.

route_description: Three pitches of climbing that gets better and better with height.  Finishes on a cool ledge with excellent views.  All in all, straight-forward and fun.  P1 (5.6, 70') Jam and stem your way up 70 feet of cracks in a gully.  Belay from a big oak tree on a spacious ledge.  P2 (5.5, 130') Perhaps the least aesthetic pitch on the climb.  Follow a crack in an obvious corner.  After approximately 80 feet, step right and follow cracks up mostly-4th class terrain.  Belay from a big oak tree on a spacious ledge.  P3 (5.5, 120') Walk up the gully and head right for about 40 feet along a grassy ledge.  Climb up to meet a left-slanting hand crack.  Climb the crack until it ends.  Traverse right for 25 feet on an unprotected slab (5.4?).  Climb a 5.5 finger crack to the top.  Belay from trees and bushes.

This worked well for me, but perhaps someone can comment on the belay situation in detail if done in 2 pitches.   In the center of the Tuna and Chips wall there is a small tower with a crack/groove on each side. 'Tuna Cookies' is on the left and 'Waterstreak' is on the right. Walk up the left side and start Tuna Cookies.  Just left of the left side of this pillar, spot a bolt perhaps 10 meters up. Make your way to this bolt and continue beyond, passing another bolt and eventually reaching the top of the pillar and the groove above it. Continue climbing up the groove on easy moves to reach the summit of the right side of the Tuna and Chips Wall and belay.   To walk off, go back and to the right and scramble down (5.0).  Like Tuna and Chips, this is a fun line and will provide good climbing for a party competent to lead it.

route_description: What can I say?  At 5.3 most will think this trivial and in fact it is well suited for a solo, date climb or neophyte first lead.  But as 5.3 routes go, it really is a pretty nice climb.  Locate the prominent cleft that that bisects the Tuna and Chips Wall.  Tuna & Chips goes up the left side of the wall and Tuna Cookies the right.  Chips and Salsa starts behind a large block at the bottom of the cleft at a low angle crack.  Waterstreak goes up the obvious polished feature to the right.  Face climb up the nicely featured rock along the crack to a belay where it opens into a wide chimney.  There is a bolt and drilled angle for an anchor, as Waterstreak joins here as well.  Wander up easier - and certainly less exposed - climbing in the chimney to the top. This is mostly scrambling and not much actual chimney technique is necessary.  Descend to the climbers right and down a gully.

route_description: This climb is a fun climb. While in the book as 2 pitches, I did not find the belay to be inspiring and was climbing with a novice at the time, so I chose to run to the top, to near the end of my 70M rope. This worked well, and he didn't mind the potential rope stretch so much as the thought of hanging on small gear in soft stone.  From the crack which splits the center of the Tuna and Chips wall ('Tuna Cookies', 5.7) walk up and left around some shrubs for 7 meters to reach a starting point on the left side of the face with good holds... and a few bolts. Climb more or less straight up on small edges and crimps past 3 bolts to a small crack, then up and onward again to the rounded top of the wall. The belay up top is reasonably secure, but may require (if memory serves) a long cordalette or webbing if you want to sit up at the edge to watch your second.  This is a fun line and will provide good climbing for a party competent to lead it. For the second, be aware of rope stretch potential, but really the climbing is straightforward and simple. Both my beginner friend and I enjoyed it.

parent_url: /v/mescalito/105732159 
route_description: This route is probably the most popular multi-pitch route in Red Rocks, and always seems to be swarming with parties.  For many years I avoided the route because it always seemed mobbed.  Then, on a day when the wind was screaming down the canyon we figured nobody would be on it.  Wrong!  Another party at the base.  We still had a fun time and everyone was very friendly and nobody was in a rush.  Good to adopt this attitude on this route - if it's high season it's going to be crowded.  This route faces south and can get quite hot.  It can be done on a sunny winter day and you could die of heat stroke in the summer.  Hike the trail to where the two forks of Pine Creek join at the base of Mescalito.  Here you want to take the left (south) fork.  Follow a trail on the north bank past a prominent buttress, then curve right up a broad, bushy gully to the base of the route.  The first pitch  faces southwest and is in the shade in early morning, it cannot be seen from the parking lot.  P1&2: Follow a 5.6 crack up and left (4" piece can be useful at one point if you want really good pro).  At 110' you hit a 2 bolt anchor, but you can continue to the next anchor (60m rope better for this).  The next bolted anchor is off to the right on a ledge, we missed it on the way up.  It is easy to get sucked left into a gully, where you can just belay from gear.  [Many parties still split this long pitch into two]  This next part is not well described in Swain: wander up and right on a huge terrace to the highest point on the ledge.  This is 3rd class except for maybe the first move, and we downclimbed it unroped on the way down, but many people choose to stay roped up for it.  P3: You are aiming for a tree at the top of a gully, make a weird boulder problem off the deck and then continue more easily up the gully to the tree, 5.5, 70'.  P4: The wall steepens.  Climb a thin crack in a black face and step left below a roof.  Follow another crack all the way up to a block slung with slings, 5.6, 150'.  P5: Above here you see some bolts, this is the 10d direct variation, go for it if you want!  The normal finish is to go down from the belay and traverse right around the corner.  Keep traversing until you are to the base of a beautiful crack in the center of a black wall, 5.3 50'.  P6: Climb the crack, angle right to a bolt, and then up a face (somewhat runout) to a 2 bolt belay, 5.6 100'.  We combined P5 and P6 with a 50m rope but this makes the final runout moves of P6 harder with all the rope drag.  You can continue to the summit of Mescalito from here (many pitches mostly 3rd and 4th with some 5th class), but virtually all rap: First 130' to the top of pitch 4 (lots of rope drag to pull, plus knobs to catch the rope, some recommend doing this as a 50' rap to an intermediate bolted anchor and then an 80' rap to the top of pitch 4).  Second rappel 140' from the big block to the tree at the top of pitch 3.  Third rappel 70' from the tree to the big ledge.  Scramble down the ledge to the bolts at the top of the second pitch (this down scramble is a little tricky at the end, watch out, maybe belay beginners).  Fourth rappel 150' from the bolts at the top of the second pitch, angling left (north) to make the ground.  We experienced bad rope drag pulling this one too and perhaps it is better to do use the  bolts atop pitch 1 to split it up into two.  I believe you could rap this with only one 60m rope EXCEPT for the second rappel.  There is an entire chapter about this route in Red Rock Odyssey

route_description: On the east side of the apron a great finger crack ascends in a rightward sloping direction. Easy protection on a moderate angle make this a classic beginners route.  Pitch 1 - (5.5) Go directly up the easy slabs along a left facing dihedral until it is overlapped by a right facing one. Continue up into the crack.  Pitch 2 - (5.6) Follow the crack as it slowly slopes to the right. At one point perfect double finger cracks open up.  Pitch 3 - (5.6) Continue up the crack until it fades out then either go up and left (easier) or go directly to the double bolt anchors across the face (a bit more difficult).  Descend the route by rapping the bolt anchors on The Grack - Marginal (if it is clear). This can be done in two raps with two 60m. Make sure you use the second bolt anchors if attempting to do it in two raps. If Marginal is crowded then you can go to the south (climbers left) and rap off blocks and trees.

parent_name: The West Slabs 
parent_url: /v/the-west-slabs/105739542 
route_description: The face of the West Slabs can be climbed almost anywhere.  The slab is extremely wide, allowing tons of variations to try. Although it doesn't matter which way you choose, I will describe my route as a rough idea of what to expect.  Also included are rough estimates of the pitch lengths.  All told, the slabs are probably close to 2000' feet of climbing. In early season, an ice axe (maybe crampons) may be helpful on the approach couloir.  The snow isn't that steep and I was easily able to kick steps without crampons.  P1) Start at the low point of the slabs, where the couloir makes a V, heading both to the left and the right of the slabs.  This pitch is mostly 3rd/4th class scrambling, with a few easy 5th class moves up to a tree with slings (190 feet).  P2) This and P3 are the two pitches that make up the 5.5 climbing on this route.  I wandered up a beautiful slabby face placing gear in face features up to the start of a left facing dihedral.  The belay was set using gear anchor on a nice flat spot in the dihedral (180 feet).  P3) Climb up the nice left facing dihedral until a huge tree on a big ledge.  This is the most easily protected and one of the best pitches of the route.  A walk off right is possible here on ledge systems. From here, the climbing eases to 5.4 or less (120 feet).  P4) A really cool pitch wanders up the juggy face.  I set a gear anchor in a horizontal crack above a sloping shelf which took small cams well (160 feet).  P5) Head up unprotectable slabbier rock, trending slightly right, to a small roof system with a tree.  Some slings are on this tree, and I backed it up with a cam in a nearby crack (150 feet).  P6) Wander up and over a small roof.  Continue rambling up the face, passing a dead tree on the left.  A rope stretcher with a bit of simul-climbing got me to a good sized pine tree just a few feet below an enormous dead tree (215 feet).  P7) Slightly to the left is a wavy right facing dihedral in light colored quartzite.  I stretched this pitch to a sloping ledge with a few features for a gear anchor (200 feet).  P8) Another ramble up a right facing dihedral gains a big tree with a good ledge (110 feet).  P9) Wander up the well featured face for most of a rope length to another tree (slightly left) with slings (180 feet).  P10) One more really easy pitch gains a huge ledge system which goes straight across the face (150 feet).  Probably two more rope lengths would reach the top from here if still roped up.  However, unroping for this easy climbing may be a good idea at this point, or even after the top of pitch 8 or 9 as described.  For the most part, every pitch seems easier than the last, and the point to unrope is different depending on the party.  Descent) Ruckman describes a specific descent for this route.  Since I did not take it, I am not familiar with where to go.  Instead, I followed the ridge up towards the North summit.  Eventually, I dropped off the ridge to the right and did a difficult traverse into the drainage between the two summits.  From the saddle, a short steep climb (difficult when snowy) gains the real summit.  After reaching the summit, the hiking trail can be taken down.  Make sure to bum a ride or bring two cars if doing this loop (the trailheads are 3 miles apart from each other)

The first pitch follows a rough corner system 60' into a steep gully, to a belay off of cracks and boulders on left side of gully. Next pitch heads up opposite side of gully along a wide (5"), jagged crack that separates a huge block from the mountain. Sparse protection through here so take advatage of everything. After 50', mantle onto the block, clip finishing bolts of climb on outside face (or contrive a beautiful directional), and head up around brief face, off of the block to a rocky belay. Walk off as described for Layback Crack.

At the Y in the trail, branch right and then take one of the dirt paths up the slope from the first picnic table.  You will need to scramble up a short 4th class gully to the belay ledge.  WARNING: Be sure you can climb or lower off this gully before going up, it can get kind of sketchy coming back down.  It's a bit easier if you go left.    For the climb, follow seven bolts to the anchors up the face to the right (the wall is east facing).  Plenty of foot and hand holds but seems pretty challanging for 5.6. This spot queues up quickly on the weekend so get there early.  Shaded most of the day.

parent_url: /v/wind-tower---sw-face/105744711 
route_description: Getting to the climb:  Hike across the bridge to the Wind Tower trail, marked by a sign that shows falling rock.  Continue north and uphill along this trail and go around the start of Wind Ridge to the north side of Wind Tower.   There are two starts to Breezy:  The 5.6 start ascends a dihedral that is sometimes used as the start to Wind Ridge.  To the left of this dihedral, the 5.5 start is at the base of a rock scramble below a skinny juniper tree.  P1:  Ascend boulders past the skinny juniper tree.  Just above the tree, put in a directional piece of pro (an alien works well) and do a hand-traverse right on a thin ledge, then scramble up  on a boulder.  A second hand-traverse and scramble up will give you access to a west-facing crack system, and here you can  see the belay ledge for Wind Ridge.  Go left around the corner and up cracks and boulders about 15 feet to the first belay, which is marked by a short, twisted juniper tree.  P2: Follow the west-facing crack system up.  Climb up to a thin ledge, then hand-traverse left on thin edges and crystals for your feet.  Clamber up to a hand-crack on the left and a  finger-crack on the right.  A Friend was stuck tight in the finger-crack when we were there, and made for a quick clip-in. Jam and stem your way up, and choose between a narrow chimney jammed full of chockstones on the left, or a clean face & dihedral on your right.  The chockstones make for easier climbing and easy natural pro, but possible rockfall!  Scramble up and over one last clean move to reach the walk-off top.  Wrap a big cordelette or 20' webbing around the boulders at the top to start your anchor, back it up with cams / hexes, and belay your second up!  The descent is a walk-off down the well used trail.  Careful of loose rock and dirt on the ledges, and be ready to put inexperienced climbers on belay if the descent is a little scary.  A fun, mixed climb with great pro.  This climb is often in the shade, so bring a jacket in the evening.  Really be careful of loose rock on this side of the Wind Tower.

Spy the large, left-facing dihedral to the right and follow up to large belay ledge with a cable anchor.

parent_name: The Whale's Tail 
parent_url: /v/the-whales-tail/105744862 
route_description: In my opinion, this is the finest beginner's lead climb in the state.  It has excellent pro and easy but airy climbing.  The traverse to the belay ledge is 4th class but exposed; it is a good idea to rope up on it.  From the roomy belay ledge, the crack goes straight up - no rope drag and no route finding.  The start is the most intimidating part, but it is easier than it looks.  Holds are generously placed in and around the crack and always where you need them.  There are a few easy jams and manteling moves.  It feels harder than 5.2 - it's steep, and the wind blowing through the canyon gives the climb some exciting exposure.  It has beautifully solid rock and wonderful, wonderful pro.  I placed my entire set of stoppers and several hexes into the crack.  The cable at the top is a good place to set up a rappel or toprope anchor; however, you can go to the top of Whale's Tail.  Beware!  A single 50m rope from the cable won't reach the belay ledge on rappel, and you'll have to do an exposed downclimb.  Use a single 60m rope, or two ropes.    From the cable, you can also choose to traverse to the bolts over the dihedral, and set up a toprope there as well.  Spend a couple of hours trying out the crack, face, and dihedral on toprope.  If you are learning to lead, you must make this one of your first!  Beautiful.

parent_url: /v/wind-tower---sw-face/105744711 
route_description: Getting to the climb:  Head up the trail toward Wind Tower; The Bomb starts at the second groove to the right of the "Huge Block" (the base of Boulder Direct).  P1: Belay from the ledge at the base of Wind Tower - setting up a ground anchor can be tricky here, and it's crowded!  Head straight up the crack to the small roof; this roof is the hardest move on pitch 1, but it protects well.  Once over the roof, climb the crack (with lots of face holds).  The rest of this pitch feels more like 5.2.    At the belay ledge, the route makes a little "jog" up and left to the base of a chimney.  Usually I  belay from the top of P1, then belay everyone over to the base of the chimney, and start the second pitch there - it reduces rope drag and the rope rubbing on rocks and such.  Note, you can toprope P1 from this belay ledge...no bolts, bring your own gear and a 60m rope.  P2: Shoot up the chimney - it narrows at the top so stay to the outside of it.  Optionally you can climb out of the chimney and use the face next to it.  For fans of stemming and counterpressure, this pitch is a real treat.  Out of the chimney, it's a little run out until you get to the dead juniper tree - but the climbing is easy.  Climb  up to an alcove and there are bolts above and to the right of the tree.  Descent:  can be done with two ropes from the bolts. 2x60m ropes are required for descent in a single two-rope rap. 2x50m and 2x55m will not reach the ledge at the base of Recon. I hung a single 50m down, and it made it to the baby tree 1/3 of the way up Recon P1.

route_description: To quote Rossiter, "This is probably the best beginner climb in the solar system." This route is best led for the first time following another party unless you don't care about finding the fixed eye-bolts. Since nearly every stance is a rest, it's tough to discern the belays.  From the East Bench, move up and to the left across a channel to the first belay. Stay on this side of the channel for the next 5-6 pitches with easy 5.0-5.2 climbing. Pitch 5 will traverse the "C" of CU. After pitch 6/7, you must cross the channel at the notch near the top. The last, crux pitch (5.4) starts on the other side of the channel to the top.  It's 6 rope-stretching pitches or 8 as described with a 50m rope.  DESCENT: There are three rappels from fixed eye-bolts. A single 50m rope is sufficient; on the last rappel, you may either use a   double-rope for the 140ft. mostly free-rappel or traverse right on a ledge and rap 72ft. on a single rope to the West Bench.

route_description: Like the Cable Route, this route is also not on the Diamond. However, of all the routes I have done on Long's, I get the most requests for beta on this one. It is very fun and popular.  Kiener's Route, also known as the Mountaineer's Route, is on the East Face of Long's and climbs parallel to the Diamond on the left. To get to the route start hiking at the Long's Peak trailhead, and hike until you reach the cutoff for Chasm Lake. Hike to Chasm Lake, and contour around it to the right in the summer, or walk right over it in the winter. On the other side of the lake is Mill's Glacier and the bottom of the Lamb's Slide. The whole 2500 foot East Face is towering above you at this point, it's quite intimidating.  The Lamb's Slide is a 1000 foot snow/ice coulior that starts on the Mill's Glacier and cuts south under the Diagonal Wall. When you're at the bottom of it, it's fairly obvious. Strap on your crampons and climb this couloir at an angle of about 50 degrees for about 1000 feet. The conditions can vary from corn snow to powder to hard, dry ice. To be absolutely sure, it is a good idea to rope up and place a screw or two every ropelength. To save time, I would suggest simul-climbing.  Eventually on the right you come to a large ledge that is covered in loose rocks and scree and dirt. This is Broadway. Traverse Broadway for about 1000 feet. The most dangerous part of the climb is here when you must walk across a ledge and step around some blocks. The ledge is less than a foot wide here and a slip would have you plummeting all the way over the Diagonal Wall. There are one or two moves of 4th class. Most people are roped up here for safety sake, and there are a couple of fixed pins and horns that can easily be slung.  After this airy catwalk, you will come to the Notch Couloir. Depending on the season, this couloir can be a very dangerous avalanche hazard. Traverse the bottom of the couloir to ledges on the other side. There are many different ways to go from here and the easiest way is not obvious. Climb up dihedrals for about two pitches. The difficulty can vary from 4th class to 5.4, depending on where you go. Take a set of nuts and be roped up just in case you get yourself into a hairy position.  Above this is 3rd class scrambling up and left, staying generally along the edge of the Diamond. At the very top is a chimney that must be climbed. Here there are also a couple of options, so look for the easiest one. The climbing is about as difficult as down below, maybe 4th class to 5.4. After climbing the chimney for a pitch, you have a very short scramble up to the summit.  This route is good in both the summer and winter but may be a bit more classic in the winter. It will feel like you are climbing a peak much bigger than Long's. This also makes the Broadway traverse more interesting because of snow. I would recommend taking a picket or two in the winter. So, have fun climbing one of the most classic mountaineering routes in the Park!

It is separated from the Flying Dutchman by the obvious Glacier rib (left in the photo). The route is 1000 feet of pure alpine fun... expect rock fall and very hard ice or snow. Wear a helmet!  Lamb's slide is most often used to approach Keiners, Alexander's chimney or Broadway.To descend you may either rappel the route (not advised) or scramble over easy 3rd class terrain to the Loft.

route_description: Wide cracks have a well-deserved reputation for being one of the more difficult genres in our sport.  I suspect this is due to the simple observation that in wide crack climbing, technique goes a long way.  Struggling up a wide crack without technique is like climbing a steep trail on skiis- without wax: just plain miserable.  Locate Easy Jam by heading left from the parking lot, and wandering through the maze of boulders to a short slab with a nice-looking diagonal crack in it (Cornelius, 5.5, excellent).  Just left is this wide crack challenge.  Wear protective clothing- minimizing pain or discomfort is a good place to start.  Now decide which side of your body you want to have inside the crack.  Think which orientation allows for the most friction (often very helpful) while reducing any awkwardness.  In leaning wide cracks it is often advantageous to have your back against the lower angle side, so that rests can easily be found by leaning back (as opposed to being forced up against the crack).  For this route you will want your left side in.  Arrange your gear on a sling, so there is nothing on your harness to get caught.    Keep in mind that in wide cracks and chimneys you can often optimize your body position to provide added security.  Done properly, it is hard to fall out of a wide crack, although the tendency for the leader is to get too deep in a wide crack, which is not always the easiest way to climbing one.   The secret to wide cracks is focusing on your lower body.  It is the legs that do most of the pushing and stabilizing.  Use your arms to maintain your position.  For this climb, heel-toe jams with the left foot work well.  You can also torque your left knee to help.  Arm bar with your left, and move systematically: secure your arms position, then release your lower body (legs, feet) and slide them to a higher position.  Now lock them in, and slide up (don't pull) with your upper body by pushing with your legs.  Lock the upper body and repeat.  This climb is a little runout, but short. If in doubt, try it on tr.  A nice progression on the Nautilus for learning wide cracks is: Easy Jam 5.4, Baldwin's Chimney 5.4, Right Parallel Space 5.5, Piton Perch 5.6, Slit 5.7, Hamburger Crack 5.7, Candlestick 5.7, Upper Slot 5.7+.  Remember that, unfortunately, easier wide cracks tend to be squeezes, and are often poorly protected, so take this progression slowly.

route_description: The NE Ridge of Lone Pine Peak is one of the 3 prominent ridges recognizable from the town of Lone Pine.  The full ridge traverse is 3 miles long and rises 6900 feet.  Many people spend multiple days on this route so be forewarned. There is no water once on the ridge, although there may be water on the descent depending on the time of year.  An abbreviated option is to access the ridge midway from the Meysan Lakes trailhead (the standard guided version).  Secor bumped this up to 5.7 in newer editions of The High Sierra: Peaks, Passes and Trails.  I did not encounter anything harder than 5.6 on the original route.  The rock is frequently crumbly (unlike the N Ridge), but the difficult sections are short and route finding was not overly challenging.  For me the crux was navigating and bushwhacking the E ledges descent for which only a vague description is available.  First winter ascent: 1994 Alois Smrz and Rich Henke

route_description: History It is possible that an indirect ascent was first made in the 1920s by Norman Clyde, Hervey Voge and David Brower, but according to Secor, the first known direct ascent was on Aug 23, 1977 by Sheari Taylor and John Vawter.  Overview and Editorial Commentary The route is asthetic, long, and climbed infrequently.  On my first attempt I found the rock to be more grainy and crumbly than the rock that is found on more popular BCS routes like the N and NE Aretes.  Our nerves were rattled after having soloed half the ridge, so we rapped off early (trip report here).  Four years later I returned to complete the route alone.  Route Details Gain the ridge at one of the notches between Peppermint Peak and BCS.  There are several from which to choose of varying rock quality and difficulty.  Depending on your downclimbing ability and preferences you may rap some of the notches.  None of the downclimbs felt harder than ~5.5.  There are many ways to go, but overall the routefinding was not difficult.    Climb the narrow arete to the top of a prominent square tower (5.8). Pass a number of gendarmes on mostly class 4 rock.  Above another small notch climb a steep headwall (5.8).  Secor grades this section as A0.  Having stared at this section I wouldn't completely disagree. It is also possible to climb the face on the right side of the tower. The rest of the ridge is picket fence type climbing.  Expect a few class 5 moves but it is mostly 4th. Follow it to the summit boulder.

route_description: An excellent route with cracks of all sizes.  It offers just about every crack technique and is highlighted by the 3rd pitch finger crack.  This route links the original routes 'Crack of No Hope' - FA-Doug Robinson/Jay Jensen, and 'Wild Kingdom' - FA-Dean Hobbs/Andy Selters.  This combination is the recommended way to go...   Pitch 1: Begin as 'West Face', but at the big ledge near the top of P-1 break left off 'West Face' and traverse along the big ledge, passing the rappel anchor and the obvious off-width.  Build a belay at the base of the next short arching crack on a nice little perch.  To decrease rope-drag belay at the rap anchor then have the follower continue past to the proper belay stance. (5.10a)  Pitch 2: Climb up the short right-arching crack past broken blocks to a thin chimney on the right side of a large detached block.  Tackle the next short off-width then left into the funky flare/V-groove (crux).  Follow the easy low-angle chimney to its top then step down and left to belay on a ledge below the obvious left-facing corner. (5.10b)  Pitch 3: Up the nice corner to the steep finger crack that leads up and right out of the corner.  Pop over the lip (crux) following the crack out right, then back left to a short traverse around the arete to a short splitter thin-hands crack.  Follow this up to a big ledge and belay at the base of the short and thin right-facing flake. (5.10c)  Pitch 4: Up the flake (crux), then thru some scrambling to the big ledge below the true summit.  Another short 4th class scramble will sit you on the top. (5.10b)  Descent:  Rappel, downclimb, or lower 40 feet down and right to the first proper rappel station on the exposed block. (5.5)  From here you have four 35 meter rappels (two 60m ropes/one 70m)

route_description: A perfect introduction to the Pinnacle, wandering up the tallest part of the wall.  West Face consists of four pitches featuring great climbing on immaculate white Sierra granite.  The route joins up with the second pitch of 'Cucumbers' near the start of pitch 3.  As a bonus, the first pitch of 'Cucumbers' can be rapped into and/or top-roped by building an anchor on a good ledge 30 feet to the right of the third pitch belay station of 'The West Face'.  We rapped off our gear, pulled ropes and led the first pitch of 'Cukes' (recommended) because it looked too good to pass up, and it was...  Pitch 1: Start at the detached block/flake with finger cracks in both sides (the right side is slightly easier, both 5.8-9ish).  Climb cracks and corners with good gear straight up then make a big step out right just below the bush into the next finger crack (crux).  Make some fun moves using a thin crack and face holds up to a huge ledge that runs to your left (this will be your last rappel station on your descent), then continue up and right a short distance to a bolt anchor on a ledge. (5.10a)   Pitch 2:  Follow the nice clean corner with good hands over the lip, then traverse right towards the next clean-cut, left-facing dihedral.  Good features on the face just left of the seam lead to the top of the corner. Step right around the arete (crux) to the bolt anchor on a small but comfortable stance. (5.10a)      Pitch 3:  (joins pitch 2 of 'Cucumbers') Step up and traverse right for 20ish feet, continuing straight up on face holds and broken crack systems to the short but sweet finger and hand crack on the slab.  Go left at the horizontal break and belay with hand-size cams at the base of the chimney. (5.10a)    Pitch 4: Climb the chimney and handcrack, then instead of going straight up the corner, break left onto semi-chossy face holds to the exposed block with the rappel anchor. (5.7-8)  Descent: Four 35 meter rappels (two 60m ropes/one 70m). On the first rappel head for the (climber's) left side of the giant roof.  You can also walk off around the back, but why would you do such a thing?

route_description: The entire route entails some challenging but very fun diverse climbing. The crux 10.b lies on the Seventh pitch. It is definitely a Classic and must DO!  Total of seven technical Pitches with an additional 300' feet of Class 3ish to reach the Summit proper.  Approach: Scramble up the right side of the pedestal (3rd class) to the bottom of the route.   P1(5.9, ~100'): Climb ~30 feet of blocky 5.6, then head up the crack just left of the arete. Belay at the "ear".   P2(5.10a, ~100'): Climb the crack straight above the "ear". Fun face moves to link crack systems. Belay at ledge.   P3(5.9, ~100'): Continue up, traversing left on the obvious sloping ledge below the orange lichen-covered bulge. Belay at the base of the "Triple Cracks".   P4(5.9, ~120'): Climb the "Triple Cracks". This seemed like the physical crux of the route. Stance belay just above the obvious alcove. The rock below the alcove is somewhat loose, there is a thin crack just above the alcove that's solid.   P5(5.8, ~100'): Take the center of 3 cracks above the alcove. The left one looks like a wide lieback, and the right one is a splitter (but grainy) thin crack. The one in the middle takes the path of least resistance. After ~50', head left up a couple of rampy lieback sections (not the splitter hand crack directly above). Belay at a large ledge below a right-facing corner.   P6(5.10b, ~120'): Climb the crux dihedral. Stiff off the bat, then eases up. Below the smaller summit block, head left up an offwidth/chimney/stem with a large fixed cam in it. Belay at large ledge.   P7(5.7, ~50'): Head up/right through a small notch, then follow the right-slanting crack system on a slab below/around the larger summit block (the huge one that's obvious from the approach). Belay on another large ledge.   You're now on the summit ridge (~500'). The climbing along the ridge is inobvious, and is definitely not 3rd class, more like mixed 4th/5th class. Lots of gendarmes and large pillars to navigate. We ended up following the ridge proper for ~200', downclimbing to the right of the ridge, then heading straight up through blocky 5.6ish climbing to the summit plateau.

route_description: This long strenuous route is a back country classic, and one of Peter Croft's "Big Four Free Climbs" of the High Sierra (see Peter's book here).  Free topo at supertopo.com/freetopos.html#r...  Start early, or move fast, or both. A very popular climb for the High Sierra.  Start on the right side of the west wall - close to where the descent gully emerges. Class 3 ledges lead left across the face.  P1 - Class 4 ramp/cracks lead to the first stiff bit - a 5.8 bulge above a short corner - a couple of moves regain easier climbing and a ledge below a steep vee chimney.  P2 (long pitch) - A technical, steep, and strenuous pitch. The chimney is tricky, follow cracks and vertical flakes up and right, with another cruxy move before the old stance (and a bolt) - keep going up enjoyable and technical moves until right underneath the Red Dihedral, stiff final moves lead to a small footledge (small pieces), rappel slings located here. Some sparse protection in places.  P3 (CRUX) - Your mates big lead. Steep and sustained 5.10- dihedral with good pro to the best rest beneath the bulge, over the bulge (5.10) to a step right, then big flakes to a belay alcove - a super-classic pitch.  P4 (long pitch) - Around onto the exposed ramp which leads steeply to easier ground, with strenuous steeper bits (5.9), followed by a 5.6 ramp/groove to a ledge below the "Splitter Crack".  P5 (200ft) - Nice approach to the splitter @ 5.10a (pure and classic), or a dihedral to the left at 5.9 (more varied) - it all depends upon what you like. Continue up more steep steps and cracks barely reaching a notch beneath the "Shattered Pillar".  P6 - Left of the pillar, corner and cracks lead to a fierce lttle lieback and a superfluous bolt. Ledges then to a 5.8 lieback, then a ledge on the left.  P7 - Up the easy corner/slab, then right beneath an overlap to a steep crack through a horizontal crack with a bulge (5.9) to step right onto a ledge/ramp, go right then up a steep crack, wander then to a ledge below a corner, and a wavy crack.  P8 - The corner and crack (5.7) lead to a slab and the notch in the north ridge.  P9 - The Class 3 ledge easily (with a final exposed step) to a chimney jammed with big blocks.  P10 - The chimney at 5.8, over blocks to a large ledge.  P11 (short) - The 5.8 corner behind (will it ever end?) and up the sandy ledge (ugh) to the bottom of the final chimney.  P12 - The chimney (5.6) to the "Keyhole" where you make your final strenuous effort and are finally birthed by the Red Dihedral. Big people will have trouble - shed all gear.

If the chimney is too wet there you can climb the face to the right of a second chimney, which is just to the right of the normal route. The chimney is blocked with a large chockstone at which point you can easily cross and move left onto an easy, but exposed ramp system that connects with the original route. Continue up class 3-4 slabs eventually leading back into the original crack for a pitch of class 4. Head up a broad chute for 500 ft, then cross left across a rib into another chute.

route_description: Wanna feel like a hero?  Here's how.    Get your gear and partner in order.  Do an excruciating approach up thousands of feet, passing hundreds of knackered tourists from all over the world.  Although a few will recognize you as a climber, most will look at you like you're a bit off in the head for shlepping an enormous, orange plastic backpack up the several million steps.  And in many ways they're right, for you're about to pull off one of the most spectacular climbs on the face of our fair planet.    After you get your ropes and anodized knick-knacks settled at the base and take your last pee, cast off!  A sea of rock; steep corners and blank faces; evening light and morning shadow; torn hands and no water to spare. Ledges that are just a little too small; gravity-defying rodents scamper about your face/head/neck and chest in the dark hours of the night looking for a wee delicacy.  At some point you're near the top.  They probably see you first, because They are always there, looking down, looking out.  They exclaim in surprise and are honestly stunned.  They cheer, and jeer, and all of a sudden you realize you're the center of attention like rarely ever in your life.  You're a hero.  Then you top out.  Your partner jugs.  You haul a bag that is, finally, light.  And the questions come.  Food and water are offered, and goddamn it, it tastes GOOD.  The light is amazing.  The view incredible...the elation is darn near making you float, and the reality of the brutal descent isn't even enough to dampen it a bit.  Congratulations!--wasn't it worth it?  Most of the climbing is very moderate--cruxes are short.  Route finding is involved but not difficult, especially with a Supertopo.  Difficulties are substantial but can be solved via smart thinking and tenacity.    The Routefinding Crux --For me it was pitch 22.  As the topo suggests, there is a smattering of bolts all over the darn thing.  Trick is, it's hard to determine which bolts to use and which to forego.  Seems as though folks have bolted different variations and knowing which bolt to pendulum to and which to pendulum from is a nit bit tricky.  The Technical Crux--Color me stupid, but the 5.8 squeeze at the after the Thank God Ledge traverse is something that no man or woman should need to endure.    The Psychological Crux--The aforementioned Thank God Ledge Traverse lives up to its billing.  You won't forget it.  Watch your rope drag, too.  The Physical Crux--Let's just say it rhymes with "falling" and "crawling" and it sucks the life out of you even faster than it sucks out the energy.  Go light, or suffer.

Descent (avoiding the South Summit): Take exposed ledges on the NE side and head for a vee notch left of the South Summit. There's a rappel anchor here which will take you, with some scambling down to the Kain Route - descend the Kain Route, rappeling when necessary until easier ground and scambling leads to the Bugaboo/Snowpatch Col.

It's 2000' tall and has pitch after pitch of 5.8 and 5.9 climbing with short sections of 5.10 thrown in here and there for good measure.  The elegant line follows a large buttress that soars up the full height of the west face.  This is a full value route with excellent climbing, great position and spectacular views.  Not to be missed.    P1:  From a slab on the right side of the ridge climb up cracks and flakes to the ridge crest and belay. (5.5)  P2:  Continue up the ridge crest and belay. (5.5)  P3:  Keep climbing the crest until it steepens then follow cracks and grooves to the left of the crest to a belay ledge. (5.7)  P4:  Climb just to the right of the crest following a finger and hand crack through a small bulge (5.10-) continue up to a small ledge and belay.   P5:  Follow cracks just to the left of the ridge to easy ground.  Continue up a flake and chimney to the left of the crest and belay on a sloping ledge. (5.8)  P6:  Traverse right on an handrail to a large left facing dihedral.  Climb up the dihedral and belay in a little alcove behind a jagged block. (5.8)  P7:  Continue up the dihedral to a crack that leads to a large ledge covered with scree. (5.8)  P8:  Climb up the scree ledge to its upper end and belay at a bivy site.  P9:  Climb a chimney and follow cracks through blocks, belay near the bottom of a steep wall. (5.6)  P10:  To the left follow a short but difficult crack to a ledge, traverse right to some opposing dihedrals and climb the right dihedral to a large flat ledge. (5.8)  P11:  This is the start of the upper headwall pitches, referred to as the Great White Headwall.  On the left side of the ledge climb a strenuous hand and fist crack up a right facing corner to a ledge.  Continue up a another crack in a left facing corner till you are able to climb out left onto a steep face to a belay ledge out left. (5.10)  P12:  Climb up above the belay and make a balance move right into a corner.  Follow the corner past some blocks and a squeeze that's hard but can be done with a pack on.  Belay at the base of a gully. (5.10)     P13:  Climb up the gully to where it steepens turning into a corner.  Follow the second crack on the left wall and belay at the bottom of a right facing corner. (5.9)  P14:  Follow the long right facing dihedral to a two pin anchor in a small notch. (5.8)  P15:  This is the crux pitch which can be aided but I didn't think it felt to hard.  Traverse out left on thin holds and make a difficult move around the arete.  Continue up an easy gully to its top and belay.  The traverse can also be tensioned at A0. (5.10+ or A0)  From the top of the Gully make one rappel off a nest of slings and follow fourth and easy fifth class terrain to the true summit.  To descend find the first rap anchor to the east of the summit and make 6 double rope rappels to the glacier.  There are numerous rap anchors on the east face so keep an eye out and make sure your ropes reach to the glacier below the bergshrund on the last rap before you commit to it.  Some parties put in a V-thread because their ropes didn't reach.

The route is not technically difficult, consisting of mostly 4th-class scrambling but the position and exposure are spectacular.  The route follows the top of the ridge nearly the whole way climbing up and over two intermediate summits before topping out on the true summit.  Simul-climbing the ridge is probably the best option if you want to go faster and still stay safe.  From the low point on the ridge scramble east to the first summit staying near the ridge-crest, sometimes to the south, sometimes to the north but never more than a few yards away.  At the top of the first summit follow slabs down to a saddle and then continue up the ridge toward the second summit.  Again stay near the crest until you get to a steep section that is avoided by following a ledge to a corner on the north side of the ridge.  The corner will lead you up to the second summit from which some easy fifth-class down climbing to the north will end at a col between the second and main summits.  From the col, move left beneath the summit following icy ramps till you get to the bottom of slab angling up to the right.  Climb up the slab continuing up a chimney to a loose gully on the left.  Climb up the gully until you get to a 10"-wide left-angling crack.  Step right to a large flake and chimney and then back left to a 5.4 handrail.  Follow the handrail for about 12' and make a reachy move up and right to easier ground that leads to the summit.   To descend either follow the same route down from the summit or make two single-rope rappels off the summit back down to the icy ramps.  From there follow the same route back down the ridge.

route_description: Considering the rock quality in a couple sections, a few insecure moves and the wide crack, that would be a burly solo! I can't decide what is more sick...Peter Croft's onsight solo or Walt Shipley's after doing the route roped and knowing what to expect!!  The route is exciting and physical and a must do for the High Sierra tick list.   Pitch 1: 3 options...Center option is a groove to a roof (slightly loose) (9+, 115').  Pitch 2: Easiest free version is to step down and traverse right on the lower crack approximately 20' where its possible to move back up to the upper crack at a good jug in between. Clip a pin and wiggle up to a roof. Fun finger/hand crack changes to a lieback to a sloping ledge where you can go left or right to end on the upper ledge with multiple 3rd pitch options (10, 200').  Pitch 3: If on the right side of the upper ledge...Go up a flake to a broken left facing corner and a piton belay on a ledge (8+, 120').  Pitch 4: Pick the easiest run out path to the corner chimney (which you don't really chimney, stay outside) (7+, 110').  Pitch 5: Hand and fists in the corner to a 6-7" OW/stem over a bulge passing old bolts. Continue up the 7-8" OW/Squeeze with a lonely old bolt to a a good ledge (10, 150'). #3 and #4 BigBro's may be nice.  Pitch 6: Go right on the ledge and up the obvious left facing corner with two bolts. At the second bolt make a wild traverse right to the finger cack groove with a squeeze finish to a jumbled ledge (10-, 190').  Pitch 7: Move right and up a bizarre corner system with a strenuous lieback. Follow broken rock to a sloping ledge under a flared goove (9+, 190').  Pitch 8: Up the groove and follow the natural weakness for a 190' pitch (5.5).  Pitch 9: 200+' fourth class loose grooves to the summit.

parent_url: /v/higher-cathedral-spire/105892236 
route_description: The easiest way up Higher Cathedral Spire.  400' of entertainment take you to the top of a spire with spectacular views.  This adventure felt like mountaneering as much as technical climbing with the steep approach, many tree belays, and sometimes loose nature of the rock.  As a note there are several variations.  I will list as I have climbed it which was great fun.  Check the Supertopo guide for a more complete picture.  Each pictch listed is about 100'.  P1 (5.5) Up a left facing dihedral to a bushy ledge.  P2 (5.9) Up a crack to a small roof.  Traverse left under the roof, then pull up over the steep bulge on decent hand holds.  Traverse left more to a nice ASCA bolt, then up and left to an easy crack.  Leads to a tree.  P3 (5.9)  Up and left to a chimney.  Traverse left around a bulge into a chimney hidden from view from the belay.  Up the chimney to another tree belay.  P4 (5.9)  The standard route goes up and left for a short pitch, then up to the top from there.  The varation (best pitch on the route in my opinion) goes straight up through some steep wildly fractured rocks to a ledge with a tree and continues up a short clean hand crack / flake.  From the top of this traverse left and then find the easiest way to the top from there.  Rappel from the ASCA bolts on the south side of the summit.  Tree rappels from there.  A single 60 meter rope or longer is highly advised.  Tie knots.

route_description: Several pitches of fun, moderate climbing that make for a pleasant outing.  The standard pitch count is listed as 7 pitches, but I'm sure you could link many with a 60 or 70m rope.  Four 5.7/5.8 pitches lead to the base of the "Great White Flake".  Continue on 5.6 that turns to 4th class terrain.  Another bit of 5.7 to 4th class, followed by an easy but super-exposed knife edge ridge.  From the summit, rap gully to the west with a single rope.

route_description: When combined with Arrowhead Arete, this makes for a pretty fun outing with lots of exposure.  Instead of climbing the first pitch of Arrowhead Arete, head a bit further east to the base of the spire and locate an easy looking corner system.  From here, climb up about 30' to a fixed pin, and continue up crack system, passing a scrub oak. Continue up a chimney, making a few tricky moves past another fixed pin. Belay at a good stance.   Pitch 2 involves some airy face climbing on featured rock. There are a couple of fixed pins on this pitch as well, and you can get gear in here and there.  The summit provides a great view of the Valley, Half Dome, Glacier Point, The Sentinel, Ahwahnee Meadow, and Mount Starr King.  From the top, 1 rap (watch your rope ends) puts you at the notch between the Spire and the Arete. One more rap sets you up for climbing Arrowhead Arete.

parent_url: /v/bullwinkle-tower/105717235 
route_description: As the title says, West Chimney.  When you get to the tower, you can walk around the main formation and look for the easiest looking chimney, if your sense of direction isn't up to par.  The climb starts with an easy slab, up over a slightly tougher bulge, before you get to the crack below the chimney.  (Approach the route and climb the bulge from the left.)  Climb the crack, which takes good pro, and has the probable crux of the route, up to the chimney proper.  You can get a last piece of gear in at the base of the chimney, but the chimney is basically unprotectable.  However, it isn't really possible to fall out of the chimney and it is much, much easier than it may look to the beginning desert climber.  Climb the fun, easy chimney to the top, there are slings on the north summit.    Descent:  A one rope rappel is straightforward if you rappel directly west of the summit anchor, however, if your second does not reach the top and you are forced to rappel back into the chimney in order to retrieve gear, be very, very careful with the force you are putting on a sketchy looking cooler sized boulder on the top.  Because of this, it is definitely not a good idea to top rope this tower from the rappel anchors.  But you could easily set up an anchor at the actual top of the chimney itself.  I find it hilarious to see the crowds (literally) lining up in bunches at the base of Owl Rock only a few hundred yards away.  This very well could be the easiest way to climb technical rock to the top of a tower on the Colorado Plateau.  It is short, sweet, easy, and right next to the road.

route_description: Hike past Owl Rock and into the drainage on the south side of Elephant Butte.  Look for a rubble filled gully leading up between two fins (see photos) and head up into it.  As it narrows and ends, you will see a small fin that comes down. Climb the fin and continue up into the next meadow.  Leave the meadow on the right and follow a bowl up as it steepens and dead-ends at a short wall.  This wall is the crux and can be climbed on either the left or right side at about 5.3-5.4.    Once above the wall follow the steep sandstone down to the left until you see five bolt hangers that aren't visible from above.  Rappel down and scramble into the lower valley.   From here, turn towards the summit and scramble up class 3/4 sandstone slabs up towards it.  Angle right as you ascend and look sharp for a cairn marking a weakness in the upper cliffs.  Once above the short cliff, climb up and find a short scramble that puts you on the summit plateau.  To descend:  As you descend the slabs down towards the valley the first rappel put you in, aim for a small pinnacle straight below (see photos).  Follow the gully next to the pinnacle down until it cliffs out.  There are three old pitons that can be used for a final free hanging rappel down.  From there simply hike down the gully, take a right and head back to the car and don't forget to smile about dodging the tourist crowds and climbing a seldom visited summit.

To reach, hike up the talus as for the Kor-Ingalls, when you reach the base, walk around to the north end of the tower and traverse out on a ledge to the base of the chimney which is right on the left hand corner of the North Face.    P1- Climb the double hand cracks in the corner.  This pitch is intimidating, but there are many rests.  The crux of the pitch is at the top where you climb over a short bulge, and then up to a small ledge to the belay.  P2- Climb a short but tricky 5.8 offwidth protected by an old bolt.  Place a big cam here instead of clipping the useless bolt.  Then climb the chimney above climbing over chockstones and varied cracks to a belay on a small ledge.  The belay takes hand size cams.  P3- Climb up the hand crack up to a stemming move at the top of the chimney which gets you to a ledge.  Climb up easy ground to a ledge where you join the Kor Ingalls.  P4- Climb the last pitch of the Kor Ingalls to the top.  To descend rappel the North Face via three raps or the Kor Ingalls via 4 raps.

It offers an excellent elevation gain while ascending both crack and face at a moderate grade.  Pitch 1:  Begin climbing in an awesome hand crack that continually narrows and eventually ends after 100ft.  Continue straight up (5.8) past two bolts (runout) to a two bolt anchor with slings and two rappel rings.  Pitch 2:  Face climb (5.8) passing the right side of *three bolts (runout).  Continue straight up over a small rooflet (small TCU) and a bolt to a two bolt anchor with slings and one rappel ring.  *Note - One more bolt than in Donald Reid's topo.  Pitch 3:  Climb a thin (small TCU) yet widening finger crack (5.7) to a large ledge.  Exit the ledge on the right (large cam) and climb up and left past a bolt (runout) to a two bolt anchor with slings and one rappel ring.

Why anyone would do one without the other, I don't know, but since they are technically two separate routes, they are listed as such.    Serenity Crack is the crux of the linkup and comprises the first three pitches of the climb.  Park at the Ahwahnee (the route is visible through the trees from the vallet area in front of the lobby) and hike in to the base.    P1:  If you don't like manufactured climbs, just go home!  This pitch is pretty unique -- I certainly have never seen anything like it:  Hundreds of blown out pin scars the size of #1 Camalots create a practical ladder up the pitch.  Unfortunately, secure gear is not available for a long, long ways, and this pitch is very unnerving to climb.  Not only that but it is painful on the toes.  Bring a full rack and be prepared to place cams in the flaring scars and sometimes great wires up higher.  Belay at bolts.  5.10a.  P2:  Climb beautiful 5.10a jams to a cruxy crack switch move higher (nice to have some small wires for this).  Continue up more 5.10a to a bolted belay.  P3:  Steep flakes and overhanging hands leads to a beautiful, thin splitter.  The crux is a section of tips jams just before the belay.  5.10d.  Romp up the large ledge system to whatever belay stance makes the most sense for starting Sons of Yesterday.

parent_name: 21 - Reed's Pinnacle Area 
parent_url: /v/21---reeds-pinnacle-area/105863765 
route_description: This is a fun caving adventure up the inside of the Reed's Pinnacle. It's a good pick for a warm day, or as a night-climb since you need a headlamp anyways. It's possible to start it either from the Left Side route, or from a hole in the wall at the start of P2 of the Direct route. Starting from the Direct route is probably the more classic option.  The chimney is straightforward for the most part. You can follow the inside of the Reed's Direct crack for a ways, but eventually you need to traverse left because the top of the chimney is capped by a bunch of chockstones. Don't place gear too high or you'll probably get terrible rope drag later on, and I'd worry about the ropes dislodging loose stuff from under the chockstone roof.  The exit is directly below the "tunnel through" on P3 of the Regular Route. This section is a bit of a squeeze. This "crux" defies all conventions of the Yosemite Decimal System, so it's hard to put a grade on. I'm a lightweight at 130lbs, and wiggled through no problem. I think it's tighter than the Narrows on the S-S, so if you found that claustrophobic you'll probably have a hard time with this one. In any case, you can either end the climb atop the large ledge to the right, or continue the traverse up and left if you want to finish on the Regular Route to the top of the pinnacle.

route_description: P1: Start on either side of a sandy flake. The FA climbed the left side of the flake at 5.7 and Harvey Carter climbed the right side on the second ascent at 5.8. We did the left side and found it quite hard for 5.7 and very loose and sandy. After scrambling up more choss to the top of the flake, climb a 5.9 fingercrack and make an awkward move left past an old hangerless bolt to the belay.  P2: Climb up left from the belay and do a fun, exposed move over a flake to a bolt ladder. This pitch can be freeclimbed at 5.10 or 5.11 depending on which guidebook you read. There are a couple of bad bolts and the holds are sandy but it looks reasonable to free, just scary with the bolts and rock quality. Then climb run out 5.4 to the summit. Rap anchors are in good condition. Two ropes get you down.

parent_url: /v/the-titan/105717006 
route_description: A certified desert classic and a visionary first ascent in its day.  Not nearly as loose as rumored, but do expect large doses of mank.  Only a couple sections require tricky aid but loads of ancient, often hilarious, fixed gear keep the excitement level high.  The aid is mostly clean but we did have to place about 7 or so pins.Most of the anchors have at least one good bolt.  There are a couple strategies for climbing this route.  Many guides call this route grade IV but only a very fast party will be able to do the route in a day.  In the end it took us about 14 hours of climbing spread over 2 days to summit.  The most likely option is to climb the first 5-1/2 pitches on the first day, fix 3 ropes down the descent route, then jug to the highpoint and finish off the route the next day.  The jugging on the descent route is miserable so if you're pretty fast (or you have the long days of late-spring) then try to do it in a day.  Approach: follow the obvious trail to the Titan, circumnavigating the tower around to the NE side.  The approach takes a little over an hour with full aid climbing regalia.  The route starts in the crack system about 30 feet to the left of the obvious descent gully.  P1- aid up the crack system, passing a false belay, to a belay about 140 feet off the deck (C1).  P2- continue up the crack system into a flaring groove, 75 feet (A2).   P3- continue up the obvious line to a ledge at the base of the Finger, 75 feet (A2).  P4- traverse the ledge around the corner (5.6) to an ancient bolt.  Aid the roof (A2, tricky) and continue to a belay on the other side of the Finger, 60 feet.  If you're lucky the pin stack we placed and couldn't clean will still be there.  P5- scramble up to a drilled pin, then continue up the strenuous flare (C1 or 5.10).  At the top of the flare, 5.8 groveling (free crux) is required to reach the belay, 80 feet.   P6- traverse around the left side of "The Duck".  On the other side of the duck is the anchor for the descent route (3 double rope rappels to the base).  continue up the wide crack system (5.8) to a large ledge (bivy site) and belay, 100 feet.  P7- traverse right around the arete to a seam.  Aid the seam (A2) back up to the crest of the arete.  Mixed free (5.7-5.8) and aid (C2) past questionable fixed gear leads to an exposed stance on the arete, 80 feet.   P8- Mixed free (5.7-5.8) and aid (C2, very long reaches, trickery necessary) past more museum relics to a wide crack.  Continue up the crack, over a roof in the caprock (wild exposure), and mantle up to the belay, 120 feet.  P9- 4th class to the summit  Descent- rappel from the top of P8 to top of P7.  Rappel from top of P7 to the anchor next to The Duck on P6.  Three rappels down the gully to the base.  You can also save yourself the trouble of walking all the way back around the Titan by making 2 double rope rappels to the west down the cliff near the base.

route_description: The West Face climbs the most obvious dihedral on the west(away from the road) face of the three gossips, and climbs to the head nearest the road.  The correct dihedral is a stellar looking handcrack with no visible fixed anchors from the base.  Be careful to find washes to reach the base-there is a lot of crypto soil and not much of a trail.  Pitch 1 - climb fingers and hands through some bulges to a big bulge just before the anchor.  There are some fixed pins at a ledge halfway up the pitch.  5.10 or awkward C1, 100'  Pitch 2 - climb a varied crack over a bulge, move left one crack system, and head over a bulge to a 5.7 squeeze chimney.  5.11 or C1.  I placed everything from a blue alien to a 5 camalot on this pitch.  130 feet, belay between the heads of the gossips.  The anchor is about 30 feet to the right of the pitch, but a good directional can be set up with large cams.  Pitch 3 - climb a sandy poorly protected slab 5.7 to the big chimney.  Tunnel in and climb unprotected to the top 5.5  70 feet, a few medium cams is all you get.  A single rope rap gets you to the shoulder.  Walk over to the station, and two double rope raps put you on the ground.

route_description: Washer Woman Tower is named so because it looks like a woman bent over an old fashion wash tub doing laundry. The route seeks suds up the Southwest face then climbs straight up the woman's head to one of the most spectacular summits in the desert.  In Search of Suds is a very high quality climb with good rock, wild exposure and an amazing view. The adventure has only begun once you reach the summit.  The route begins on the right side of the Southwest face,  there are several ways to get there. It is best to begin the route from the saddle between Washer Woman and Monster Tower. The best approach is from the South via steep talus  slopes.  Pitch 1: 5.10- 85" Scramble to the saddle and begin climbing off the left side of the ridge in a steep fist crack with difficult moves  right off the deck. Continue up and pass an offwidth section and belay at a bolt anchor with slings. You should be able to see daylight through a small eye piercing the tower above. Beware of loose rock on this pitch.  Pitch 2: 5.10- 90" Climb up to an airy stance near the Eye and sling a chockstone for pro before moving into the crack left of the eye. Make some 5.9 moves and continue up to easier climbing in the crack above. Pass a squeeze chimney through a bulge and make scary moves on sandy sloping holds out of the chimney and onto the belay ledge. Belay at 3 bolt anchor with slings below a roof.  Pitch 3: 5.10+ 70" From the comfortable belay ledge move directly right and  into a good hand/fist crack with a roof above. Power through the roof with several 5.10 moves and make a difficult move  up and right above the roof (5.10+, TCU). Continue to the ridge on fun 5.9 crack climbing. Arrange a gear belay on the ridge.  Pitch 4: 5.6 70" Traverse along the ridge towards the summit and belay where it steepens. This can be combined with the next pitch.  Pitch 5: 5.9 20" Face climb a short steep section with an old pin, Belay at bolt anchor on large ledge below final headwall.   Pitch 6: 5.10+ 80" Face climb up past some loose rotten bands (5.9R) to a  beautiful black varnished face with four drilled pitons.  Face climb on small holds up and past the bolts to a mind  blowing summit and belay at bolt anchor.  Descent: 3 or 4 two-rope rappels down the Kor Route  Rap 1: Rap back to the ledge at the base of the last pitch.  Rap 2: Rappel through the arch! Carefully thread anchors  just over the edge of the South side and make a wild free hanging rappel down the face to a set of Metolius rap bolts. Getting over the edge to start this rappel is tricky  and way spooky. This is one of the most incredible rappels in the world. Be very careful of loose rock when you pull the ropes after this rap.  Rap 3: If you have two 60 meter ropes you can hit the ground on this rappel. If not look for the best set of bolts (several exist) and make another rappel.

route_description: This route is pretty darn good, especially if you like off-widths.  Approach up talus and across a ledge system from the right of the formation.  Head around the base to the left - this is the first crack system in a dihedral you come to.  The first pitch of the route basically starts at fingers and works its way to fists - the crux being getting over the obvious bulge.  Belay at fixed anchors 2/3 the way up the tower.  The last third of the tower is a delightful struggle up a flaring off-width - the definite crux of the route.  "Chimney" is a misnomer for this thing, the only thing I could squeeze in there were chicken wings and knees.  Two ropes gets you completely off the route, but it looked feasible to do it in two, single rope rappels.

Head to the obvious blocks on the Great Wall (as my partner pointed out, they look like a stop-action photo of a large block slowing toppling over to the left), and to the crack in the dihedral to a three bolt anchor.

parent_name: Off Balanced Rock 
parent_url: /v/off-balanced-rock/105717119 
route_description: The route follows the obvious crack/weakness in the center of the northeast face on the formation.  The route starts just left of two deceivingly big boulders in front of the northeast face.  Note: The route can be climbed in one pitch with a 60 meter rope, however this is not recommended due to rope drag and poor communication once inside of the chimney.  Pitch One: Follow the obvious crack up and then right over a couple of small ledges for approximately 60 feet? until you come to a good ledge with a rappel anchor/belay station. (I am not positive how long this 1st pitch is, but it is pretty short.)  This part of the climb is easily protected, the rock is a bit loose in some spots and is an easy 5.6 pitch.  If this pitch had slightly better rock, I would consider this route 3 star.  Pitch Two: The standard route second pitch steps right from the belay, goes thru a tunnel, to a crack on the far side of the chimney, from where it is easy (and enjoyable) 5.6 G-rated climbing. It is not at all obvious, and i started up the obvious off-width first, but goint right it is the safest and easiest way to the top, and should therefore be considered the standard route.   Pitch Two Variation: Straight up "thru" a 5.7 offwidth, which is pretty much unprotectable.  Have a small cam available for one possible placement that I found. (I didn't have one, and put a nut in for psychological comfort, however, if you fall here you will probably hit the belay ledge anyway.)  I also had a #4 Big Bro which i placed for more comfort, but it later fell out due to rope drag.  So this is what I would consider the R section.  The climbing isn't that hard, but you probably don't want to fall here.  In that sense, it is a classic offwidth.  After about 15-20 feet you will finally come to a place where you can enter the chimney proper.  It isn't as much of a haven as is hoped, but jump in and traverse into the chimney and out of sight.  A 15 foot traverse will bring you to an intimidating "room."  This is really a classic chimney opportunity and, if it weren't for the offwidth downclimb, would be a point for retreat I imagine, after your initial view upward.  This chimney is rated 5.6 (remember that...)and instead of just rushing blindly upward, continue to traverse deeper into the chimney until you come to a crack system that is on the left wall.  This is the point of easiest upward progress, and occasionally as you get higher you will have great protection opportunities.  Eventually you will jump into the crack as it approaches the top of the tower and 15 more feet will lead you to the anchors.  The second pitch is about 90 feet in length.  Descent:  With a 60 meter rope you can reach the belay ledge on top of the first pitch, and easily use the same rope for a second rappel to the ground.  Two ropes should easily reach the ground from the top, and if they don't you can stop at the belay/rappel ledge above mentioned.  Rappel the route.   Side notes:  Overall this is really a fantastic adventure climb for the moderate leader.  I climbed it to avoid crowds at owl rock and because it is one of the few moderately rated routes in the desert, however, what I found was totally unexpected.  This route deserves much more respect.  It is exciting and feels like a nice accomplishment.  If 5.7 is your limit however, you are probably much better off climbing owl rock where you can sew the route up with gear.  Climbing Owl Rock the next day was easy compared with the spirit of the Northeast Chimney route.  Enjoy!  As the details of this climb were unknown to me before I climbed it, and as I don't know anyone else who has climbed this route I look forward to reading future comments... perhaps I am off base with my enthusiasm, let me know.

Expect a sustained climb with three definite parts, and good rests in between each - it's harder than it looks, and the cruxes are pumpy.  Reach the climb about 350 feet (less than .1 mile) past a large break in the otherwise solid wall of Wall Street.  If you pass a long (several hundred feet) section of lower angled slabs, you've gone too far.  Lieback and jam a left-facing corner (with a couple of face features for variety) at the right end of a 3-car turnout for 80' to good anchors on the facing wall.  Rap the route.

It starts 2 climbs left of the prominent and popular LF corner, "30 Seconds Over Potash" (in between is a thin .10a LF corner, Lucy in the Sky with Potash").  The first bolt is a bit high (climb in from the right), but once clipped it will be at your waist for the crux sequence.  Above is 5.8-5.9ish climbing with 3 adequately spaced bolts, to a good bolted anchor.

Climb the crack using horns, jugs, knobs, some jams and stems, and at least one awkward left-stepping face move to a ledge with 3 bolts 10' below the summit.  The majority of the route goes at pretty decent 8, but be prepared for some slightly harder moves - the sandstone has eroded a bit and the climb is getting harder.  Belay from here - there's plenty of room for several people on the ledge.  Scramble up easy 4th class rock with some foot pockets to the summit (a piton on top and on an intermediate ledge assist in protecting this scramble) for an excellent view of the Garden of Eden.  Rap (do not lower) the route from the three-bolt anchor on the ledge.

It gets morning sun, so you don't have to wait in the winter to get on it.  The route is basically a bolt-ladder of six bolts, with a couple 5.8 moves required to reach the first bolt, and to move from the last bolt to the summit.  It's very easy, and the bolts are solid.  When we did it, we actually drove the truck right under the route and stood on the roof to reach the first bolt (very lazy, indeed).  On the summit are two good bolts with rap slings.

route_description: The East Buttress of El Cap is a classic adventure up the right hand shoulder of El Cap.  You don't get the feeling you're actually on El Cap, though you are afforded with great views of the tremendous southeast face. Of note, the route also serves as a convenient introduction to the East Slabs descent route which is very nearby upon topping out.  As one of the more popular routes in the Valley, so be prepared for traffic jams and a long day, but because the crux comes early and most of the climbing is much more moderate, fast parties can usually finish the route in about half a day.  Approach is typically via a slog up the ramp or the Moratorium. The latter adds four amazing (and more difficult) pitches to the East Buttress, but is somewhat out of character which is one of adventure.  Sorry about the brief description. I adopted it and haven't had a chance to update it - I will add a pitch-by-pitch breakdown shortly.

route_description: This route is long and complex and contains some bad rock, plus a couple of difficult offwidth or chimney pitches.  There is not much to recommend it except for a lot of history and great position.  This route is in full sun all day and is not recommended in the middle of the summer.  It is rated Grade IV but I know several parties who have gotten benighted on this route.  The variation described here is often called "Yosemite Point Buttress Direct", although it is far from direct.  I guess the FA line wandered even more!  I found this climb frustrating because the typical pitch climbs down 30 feet, goes around a corner, and then ascends some wide crack with lots of potential for rope drag.  The first pitch follows cracks over a bulge (5.8).  The rock here is not so great and gives you a taste for what you are in for.  Move the belay right and down 100' or so.  Now head up a 5.8 chimney to the base of a steep wall.  Pitch 3: here now is one of strangest and most notorious 5.9 pitches in Yosemite Valley (pioneered by the late Galen Rowell, I believe, anybody know?).  Follow a ramp down and right some 20-30 feet then hand traverse right around a corner.  Here you finally see your nemesis, a flared 4-12 inch crack.  Since you just climbed down, you can't put any gear in for some distance (or suffer epic rope drag).  To add to your torment, a number of trees on the ledges above yield a bounty of leaves every fall which fill sections of this crack.  If this route was done more often it would be cleaner.  Recent ascents report a fixed #4 Camalot on this pitch.  An alternative 3rd pitch is to retreat to the belay and follow the equally bizarre OAM variation (Offwidth Avoidance Maneuver).  Climb a scrubby tree above the belay to a small roof, and continue up a steep 1-2" crack in the wall above.  Before this crack ends, make a difficult face traverse right to the top of the offwidth crack (5.10).  This variation avoids all but the last 10' of the offwidth (now fist-sized), but is rated harder than the offwidth.  However, it is well protected.  If you place a cam as high as possible in the crack it almost gives you a toprope on the traverse.  Your next goal is to reach a large tree about 400 feet higher [rumored to be missing as of 2010].  This tree [was] over 3 feet in diameter and [was] easily visible from outside the visitor center (you did check out the route from here the day before, right?).  To reach it requires four pitches, the first follows cracks straight up, then the next few are more wandering in nature as shown in the Reid topo.  Anyway, it helps if you realize your eventual target is this tree.  From the big tree head left and up, eventually following an easy chimney.  This leads to another famous pitch, the "rotten chimney".  This pitch is not particularly hard (5.8?), but the crux is unprotectable.  This is to be expected in most 5.8 chimneys but the rock on this one is poor.  Make sure the belay anchor is bombproof on this pitch, which is problematic.  It may be useful to actually climb down once you see this pitch ahead to find the best possible belay anchor.  The rotten chimney pitch puts you on top of a prominent, sandy, pedestal.  The next two pitches are the best on the entire route, for the rock quality is much better.  Cross to the west side of the pedestal and move up and left on rounded holds (5.9 hard to protect) to a diagonal crack with many fixed pitons.  Eventually move back right and belay on a ledge near several loose blocks.  You now want to move back left into an obvious crack above.  Make a tricky move into the start of this crack, which is very wide here.  Soon it necks down to perfect handjam size.  Jam this excellent crack (5.9).  The rock quality deteriorates at the top of this pitch, making a reliable anchor difficult to build.  The last hard pitch is easy technically (5.4), but suffers from bogus sandy rock, which makes it much scarier than the rating indicates.  Climb up, then traverse left on a sandy ledge and then continue up, here a funky stake has been driven straight into the rock for protection (probably gone by now).  Exercise extreme caution.  One more easier pitch ends at the Yosemite Point railing.  For more information and opinions on this route check out this forum post on SuperTopo

route_description: One of Peter Croft's "Big Four Free Climbs" of the High Sierra (see Peter's book here).  This is possibly the most direct line on Temple Crag, taking a plumb line from the lowest point of the face to the top. Either start from the nadir of the face and climb 400 feet of lower class 5, or walk up around the left side and traverse back right on a large ledge.   Climb up to a small, right facing dihedral and climb it (crux). On the next pitch, work your way up and left to a crack below a chimney. Get into the chimney, eventually tunneling through to get to more moderate ground above.   From here it is mainly alpine ridge climbing, with a few steps which can be tackled straight on or avoided to the side. Eventually you reach the top of Temple Crag. Whew!  Pitch by pitch  Rack-Heavy on the thin stuff, lots of slings, extra thin nuts.  You may not even need a #4...or 3!  P1-5.10b After you've scrambled up to the base and made some 4th class moves out to the pedestal proper, you'll be looking at some dihedrals and thinking "what wild quartz" if you've got the same topo we did.  Careful examination of the photos here might jog your memory.  Feel free to download them to your smart card and pop them in your camera!  This pitch is steep and mostly fun with a hard 10 move in the corner.   P2-5.8  Head up the corner to the top.  Short pitch with a bolt.  Steep and fun. Possible to combine 1 and 2.  P3-5.9  Traverse left for perhaps 40' but don't go to the end of the ledges way left.  Look for a seemingly improbable corner with a lazer split super thin crack in a small golden corner.  This  seemed hard to me.  Funky pins at belay mark the way, supplement with thin wires.  P3-5.7  Head straight up featured rock, aiming for the obvious chimney.  I think we combined this with P4 on the topo to take us to the base of the chimney.    P4/5-5.8  Very cool (even cold) chimney.  The crux is dragging packs through it.  Not as hard as Valley 5.8 thankfully.  Plenty of great holds inside.  Great pitch.  P6-5.8-ish.  You are now on the ridge!  Follow cracks up, generally maybe staying on the right side.  Be careful as much choss abounds from this point on.  P7-3rd/4th  Same as P6.  P8-3rd/4th  Same as it ever was...try to meter your energy, plenty of climbing left!    P9-5.7 You made it! (to the top of the lower buttress).  This next pitch was wild and runout but easy.  Trending to the left, face climb up lovely grey rock.  Some harder moves surmounting a small roof were better protected near the top.  P10-5.7 Our topo and route seemed to deviate here.  We stayed left and avoided a 5.10 roof on the topo.  Seemed about 5.7 or 8, and mostly face rather than the 5.7 wide on the topo.  P11-More 4th, staying on the right side of the ridge in general was the ticket for us.  I think this may have been the Dark Star pitch, an incredibly amazing crystal hole.  If you keep your eyes peeled, you just might see it.  P12-14 (5th)-From here, another set of deviations from the topo.  We started to simul a bit and solo here for several hundred feet.  We also rapped and downclimbed across to the sandy gap.  There was some fixed gear.  We made a second downclimb after the rappel a ways further on the ridge.  The 5.10 variation on the last buttress looks wonderful, but really greasy in the blazing sun.  We wandered around in the gully on the left.  P15-More 4th and 5th, gully whomping.  Looks like you'd be rapping/traving little towers and generally "unclean" climbing if you were staying on the ridge proper (via the 5.10 mentioned above).  P16-4th  Top out on ridge.  From here you can drop all ropes and gear if you are confident on hideously exposed 3rd class about 50' from the top of the summit.  Watch yerself around the keyhole...  Descent-work your way down the gully a long, long ways.  Stay up high and go straight down before it steepens dramatically and drops to the right.  Scrambling down a ton of exposed ledges and steppes will lead to an obvious rappel on blocks to the very top of Contact Pass.  Alternatively, I've gone down the aforementioned gully...there are anchors (bolted iirc) but you end up way below the pass and have to scramble up sand to get to the pass proper.  Expect "1 step forward, 2 step back" if you do this.  Once on Contact, pick your way down.  It will probably be horrible, so expect loose blocks, sandy crap and everything in between. Best of luck.  Last time we got lucky and glissaded a bunch, but the other times I've had a terrifically bad time route finding this choss.  Once you're back at camp, yell a loud "braaaack"!  You just did DS!

route_description: A popular and classic line on a lower Teton summit.  Because of the many large ledges there is loose rock in places.  The climb has a few steep sections but is easily protected and has straightforward route finding. Many variations are possible.  In spite of the proximity to Jenny Lk, the approach & descend in the loose couloir takes several hours.    Rope up near some trees at the base of the arete.    P1 - Climb shallow cracks straight up for 20' then move through easier terrain to an open dihedral.  P2 - Ascend the open book (5.5) then a left-leaning ramp.  Ascend double cracks (5.6) just right of the arete and continue on easier, blocky terrain.  Belay right below dihedrals leading to a triple roof.  P3 - Sometimes called "the Nose" or "the Dihedral" pitch. Ascend the slick dihedrals (5.7 - or drop right to a 5.6 crack) and pass the roofs on the right.  Stay close to the arete and ascend broken terrain to the base of a yellow slab.  P4 - Move left onto the yellow slab (sometimes also called "the Nose") to an old pin, place a small stopper in a diagonal crack for back-up and make a friction move (5.7) right up to a ledge.  Continue for 30' on easy ground to a small bulge in a constriction.  Surmount the bulge and continue up dark rock, eventually climbing a nicely featured black face just left of the crest to a large ledge.  (The yellow slab can be climbed at the end of P3 and may leave you more rope for the long P4.)  P5 - Move the belay down to the base of a right slanting ramp.  Ascend this ramp, then climb cracks up the steep wall above.  Head for a large flake that protrudes out from the arete. You can pass behind the flake in the chimney or (more fun) by a nice crack on the outside (5.6.)  Step right and belay on the large ledge.  To continue to the summit, it's a sometimes-exposed 400' scramble to the east.  Begin on the crest of the ridge, then move right on a small ledge to a large notch above the descent route.  You can rappel (1 rope) to the west from here if you prefer.  To continue to the summit, move 50' right until ledges lead up and left around the nose of the arete to the top.  The descent begins down the NE face then moves west to the SW Couloir.

route_description: Much more demanding as a cardio undertaking than as a technical one, this climb is a must do for the inspiring views it provides. The ascent probably does not merit four stars, but the abrupt view from the top does.  From the north end of the Lupine Meadows parking lot, take either of two trails (they quickly merge) which head towards Teewinot.  The trail is quite smooth and well graded.  Encounter the first of the 18 infamous switchbacks after about 1/2 an hour then follow these, mostly through steep, open meadows (no shade, lots of flowers in mid summer) for about a thousand feet of gain.  My experience was that the SBs go faster if you count them.  At about 9000' the trail hits a ridgeline along which are the only reasonable potential bivy sites (check w/ the rangers about the availability of water).  Around 10500', just below two spires, The Idol and The Worshipper, you will likely encounter snow.  Somewhere around this point it would be a good idea to get your bearings and study the configuration of the summit ridge -- routefinding is straightforward if you do this, but plenty of people get lost anyway.  The general idea is that you want to aim for the tower immediately to the right of the central drainage/gully/chimney system the upper reaches of which in early to mid season will have snow to the skyline.  Higher on the mountain the snowfield can be hidden from view so try and pick out a couple of distinctive features on the high on rock towers to maintain your bearing.  From the 10,500' point, go right/north around the I & W -- we followed steps up easy snow (~30 degrees?) for about 300' gain; in the conditions we encountered it, crampons were not needed for this section, but an ice axe was nice to have.  Once the snow ends, scramble for several hundred feet.  I ascended to the south of the central gully and descended to the north.  The trail, hard to find with snow, seemed to be on the north which was at any rate the easier way to go.  Finding the easiest line involved a fair amount of zig-zagging.  The crux was just below some red rap slings on the south side.  The scrambling was less enjoyable than I expected due to the slopey and dirty nature of much of the rock.  About 500' below the summit, follow easier (mostly class II) ground on the north side of the drainage to the top.    Your exertions should be amply rewarded by the summit views from Mt Moran down to Buck Mountain with a particularly compelling vista of the north side of the grand.

route_description: A truly inspiring climb with classic appeal - the North Ridge is an adventurous route up the striking high angle corner that makes up the right hand skyline of the Grand when seen from Jackson Hole.  At the time of its first ascent in 1931, Underhill and Fryxell's route was one of the most technically demanding in the country at 5.7 A0.  The Chockstone Chimney (originally aided) went free on the second ascent of the route in 1936, which was made by Fritz Weissner (at 5.8).    The North Ridge of the Grand is one Steck and Roper's 50 Classic Climbs of North America, and justifiably so.  An intricate approach leads to quality, varied climbing at a moderate grade in a beautiful setting.  The route takes you up an obvious path to the most spectacular summit in Wyoming.  Description of Route The route described here is the original North Ridge as climbed in 1931.  Many variations are possible.  The famous chimney pitches of the original route are commonly icy, except during prolonged periods of high pressure in the summer.  If the chimneys are icy (or just because the climbing is good), another popular option is the Italian Cracks.  Also, the technical climbing of the route can be extended by finishing on the Direct North Face.  Both these variations to the North Ridge are further explained here.  Once you get started, the climb is pretty easy to follow - take the path of least resistance up the ridge.  That said, a few landmarks are worth nothing: On the first pitch, climb easy rock to a flake, and squirm behind the flake (climbing to the left) to steeper rock for a few moves (5.7), followed by more gently angled rock.  Take the gully to the base of the Chockstone Chimney.  Follow pitons on the right wall to the stemming crux, 5.8.  Next is the Black Rock Chimney, 5.7.  After exiting the chimney system, climb the beautiful orange Slab Pitch.  Go right along the Second Ledge to a left-facing corner with good, solid, golden Teton rock.  Follow this for 2 or 3 more pitches to the top.  Expect much 5.7 climbing on this route.

route_description: The Serendipity Arete, approximately the west ridge of Mt Owen, is much better characterized as a mountain adventure rather than a rock climb.  Most people will probably find the approach and descent more demanding than the climb itself.  The climbing generally consists of short, steep sections with lots of scrambling in between.  Retreat from the route would probably entail much downclimbing.  Approach:  Cross Jenny Lake somehow, then walk up the Cascade Canyon trail for about three miles, until past the Valhalla streambed.  Ford the river (< 12" deep in late August) and head steeply up the west side of the Valhalla streambed.  If you're lucky, you'll find a pronounced trail; otherwise you'll probably follow intermittent trails.  Either will get you to the lower reaches of VC where the trail ends and the slope eases off.  Note: We were able to find water in the middle part of VC (while still in the basin, before scrambling up onto the slopes of Owen itself) late in the season.  We didn't see any convenient water source above this.  The crux of Serendipity is probably finding the start.  We lost a lot of time by convincing ourselves that the route started lower than it did which resulted in a lot of completely unnecessary scrambling.  The key to avoiding this mistake is to identify a large, very prominent, orangey left-facing corner with a square roof at the bottom of its right side.  Identify this corner from the basin and then accept the fact that the route starts about a pitch below the large corner, surprisingly far above you.  A secondary landmark is a long, shallow black roof below and slightly right of the large corner; this feature is passed to its left about 25M into the first pitch.  From the middle of the basin, don't beeline for the corner.  Instead, continue up VC, toward the Grand, until almost the end of the canyon.  Now go left/E, up scree towards the Gunsight, gaining several hundred feet.   At some point, trusting your instincts and judgement, cut left/north when it seems like you could traverse more or less horizontally to a point about 25M below the long black roof.  Eventually, you'll encounter a descending slab below a roof/cave which will take you to a small, stamped out area at the base of a 5M right facing corner.  This is the start.  Getting to the start from west side of Jenny Lake took us almost seven hours.  A quick party should probably allocate at least five hours without mistakes.  P1.  Go straight up for a ways, passing the long, black  roof on its left, then traverse right on slabs, eventually encountering some FPs.  Try to traverse all the way around the arete, to a good stance at the base of a chimney. ~5.7, 75M.  (To break this pitch up, find an intermediate belay before the traverse, maybe on a pedestal left of the black roof.)  P2. Go up the chimney, probably using a slippery hand crack, then continue up, trending left, on easier ground to the base of a slab with a 5" crack on its left side.  ~5.7, 50M.  P3. Up the slab w/ no pro (5.5?) and continue on easier ground to the top of the first tower. ~5.5, 50M.  P4. Walk across the "knife edge" (it's a pretty blunt edge), climb a couple of moves up a block, then diagonal down right for about 10M and belay beneath broken, black rock.  Easy, 30M  P5. Follow cracks up to a notch behind the 2nd tower.  ~5.6, 40M.  P6. Climb cracks (straight up or veering right) and gain a ledgey area near the top of the 3rd tower.  ~5.5, 50M.  Note: this area around the notch btw the 3rd & 4th ledges offers the best bivy spots on the route.  P7.  Pass through the notch to left/NW side of the 4th Tower, then descend a ramp for a little ways until the rock above you looks climbable. 4th class, 20M.  P8. Climb up for most of a rope until you reach easier ground.  ~5.7 50M.  Rossiter indicated this section was easier so maybe we were off route.  P9.  Wander up, aiming for the right side of the ridge.  Keep going, past the 4th tower, until a notch btw the 4th tower and the next difficult section.  4th class 60M.  P10.  Up past a warm up chimney type move to the base of a short, smooth, bulging 7" crack. Either free climb this (allegedly 5.9) or aid up a thin crack just to its right (FP, red or green RP probably helpful) for a move or two.  Continue up easily until beneath the summit block. 5.7 C1 50M.  P11. Scramble rightwards until at the base of the Koven chimney, a passage which goes all the way through the summit block.  4th class 50M.  Unrope, and scramble up the chimney the remaining 100 feet to the summit.  Descent: I can't speak entirely from personal experience since we kept going to the Grand, but the best bet seems to be descending the West Ledges back into Valhalla Canyon.  The general idea here is, starting from the base of the Koven chimney descend the east side of ridge running from Owen to the Gunsight (possibly 1 rap) until the obvious "U notch" where you crossover to the west and descend with a fair amount of downclimbing into Valhalla Canyon.

route_description: Your first goal is to reach Wall Street, a giant ledge leading to the crest of the south ridge from the west at around 12,800'. This ledge can be easily viewed from the Lower Saddle if you know where to look. Begin from the Lower Saddle as for the Owen Spalding, passing left of the smooth pinnacle known as "The Needle", then up the gully on the right, close to the Needle. If you are lucky you will find the tunnel above here known as "The Eye of The Needle", but it is not necessary to pass through this feature. Above here your route diverges from the Owen Spalding as you traverse right, crossing a broad and relatively easy couloir to the start of Wall Street. This couloir drops straight down from the Upper Saddle and has led to disaster for many tired climbers descending from the Upper Saddle, assuming it is the way down (it cliffs out). Take note of it.  The Wall Street ledge is huge and easy to walk along, until the very end where it suddenly becomes exposed and narrow. Rope up here, unless you feel like repeating Glenn Exum's famous leap. Actually, I've never seen anyone leap to span this difficulty, as you can simply make a long step or hand traverse. Still, it is very exposed and only climbers in a great hurry will do this unroped.  Next comes the Golden Stair pitch, which ascends directly up the ridge up a steep, knobby face.  This pitch looks harder than it is, because it is very exposed and the protection is not abundant.  Plenty of knobs make the climbing enjoyable.  After this pitch the difficulty eases and if your party is experienced you may want to pack the rope for a while, or simulclimb.  Follow a horizontal section near the ridge crest, then move left to gain access into a gully which slants up and right.  This is called the Wind Tunnel.  This leads, after a number of pitches, to the base of the Friction Pitch.  When the Wind Tunnel gully begins to lean back to the left, this is the point where you exit it straight up to the base of the Friction Pitch, which is back on the crest.  If you follow the gully too far, it turns into more of a ramp and eventually ends.  This is easy to do as it is the path of least resistence.  If you make this mistake, either backtrack to the Friction Pitch, or head straight up to the crest up a chimney, rejoining the route above the Friction Pitch.  The Friction Pitch is called by some the crux of the route, it is not well protected but the difficulties ease shortly.  Above here scramble for 2 more pitches, following the line of least resistence.  Look for a section above where you can cross back to the west side of the crest to avoid a slabby tower.  Above you is the "V" pitch, one of the most exposed on the route.  Climb the obvious SW facing dihedral above, with excellent protection.  I feel this section is the crux of the route.  After this pitch the ridge levels out and is quite easy for a short section.  The next difficulty encountered following the crest is called the Petzoldt lieback pitch.  When I last did this pitch in September it was covered with ice and quite a challenge in rock shoes.  Above here you can climb a small 10' tower directly via a crack and in another 100' the ridge becomes broad and nearly level.  Here you can unrope and scramble to the east of the crest to the summit.

route_description: The Lower Exum Ridge is a classic route on the southeast side of the Grand Teton.  All of the pitches are good but the 5th pitch is by far the best being that it's steep, exposed and still only 5.7.   P1: A large chimney with some chockstones in it.  Squeeze through a hole under the chockstones about halfway up and then climb out of the chimney on the right shortly after that and up to a large ledge.  P2: Climb easy terrain up and left following some cracks to another nice ledge.  P3: Move the belay to the base of a nice hand crack.  Climb the crack up and left then traverse back right and pull up onto lower angle rock.    P4: Climb up past a large chockstone (I climbed around it on the outside) and to a broken up ledge at the base of the steep 5th pitch.  (Pitches 3 and 4 can be combined barely with a 50m rope)  P5: Climb up and right from the ledge and follow a crack with a few pins in it.  Belay at a pin and fixed cam.    P6: Climb straight up an awkward crack on smooth rock and then head right on easier terrain but with minimal gear.  Belay on Wall Street ledge.  (An easier option is to go left from the belay which also ends up on Wall Street)    Combining the Lower and Upper Exum Ridge to the summit is a great way to climb the Grand.

Traverse the first one, which is called Pinnochio Pinnacle, on its west side. Go on the east side of the second higher one, named Bonney's Pinnacle.   2) On the far side of Bonney's (south), you'll see a notch that's been formed by the erosion of a small dike. Climb up out of the notch, (easy) and head towards a ledge that leads around on the left side of the ridge. Traverse along on the ledge for approximately 50 feet before heading to the right on another ledge for about 60 feet to a cave-like notch (room) in the ridge.   3) The easiest way out of the so-called room is to descend a few feet to some ledges below and to the right. Then traverse to the west (right) along these ledges into the left edge of the northwest gully.  4) Stay on the right side of the north ridge and in or near the northwest gully. Finally turn left (east) and carefully ascend the crumbling slope of the Black Dike to the sharp notch at the top. In late 9/86, JHMG, Mark Whiton and I had to kick steps. A storm the night before laid down about 4 inches of snow and caused verglas to form on the upper 1000 feet of the Grand. Therefore, this climb became our objective. In the winter-like conditions, climbing out of the notch was the crux for us. Mark started high and led through a 5.8 move. Down a little and to the right it's supposed to be only 5.5?   5) Above the notch, (a bolt and good horizontal crack provided belay). From there easy ledges and slabs go up and around to the east and to the south summit. When Mark and I reached it, we were alone. The wind died and while huge flakes still floated down, the sun came out. Icefloe Lake below just sparkled. Then a party of four ascending the Southwest Couloir (3rd Class) soon joined us.  Most probably downclimb the Southwest Couloir. We traversed back north along the east side of the main summit block -- great view of the whole south side of the Grand -- where a gap allows you to head left (west) back over to the top of the black dike notch. We rapped from there into the dike notch and retraced the North Ridge route back to the Lower Saddle.

parent_url: /v/disappointment-peak/105803650 
route_description: This route is, by itself, worth going to Jackson. Not a bad pitch or belay station on this climb.  Pitch 1 (5.7) is marked by a tree located well to the climber's right of the arete proper. Straightforward to the belay at a good stance with a block. If traversing in from the Caves area, you won't start at the tree (nor will you be able to see the tree), you will probably rope up and traverse in about 40' above the tree then my suggestion is to make an intermediate belay as there is a flake that catches the rope which could give you fits as you try to belay your second to the start of P2.  Pitch 2 (5.8) is the most serious & sustained of the climb. You follow the natural line which is somewhat flaring & somewhat OW. There is a pin at the crux, but it will not protect you until after you move through it. Focus & be solid at 5.8, this pitch is a fight. Belay at a huge ledge, take a breather, & rehydrate. It is possible to escape this route going to the right at this point (If you wanted to get a couple of pitches in while camping @ the Meadows before heading to the Grand - this is a good venue). There are 2 raps, we used 60M, I don't know if a 50M will allow for you to escape without burning gear.  Pitch 3 (original - 5.7) Cross over the arete back & forth on a roofy pitch with a black rock band; really cool face climbing with roof pulls. Reminds you of Eldo. As I was moving across the arete, what was a calm morning became a gusty alpine day. Scared the shit out of me, as my position was on the edge. Finish at an obvious good belay ledge.   (variant 5.9, is climber's right and follows up a natural line going back left into the black rock band. I think R. Rossiter has a picture of the 5.7 in his guide book.  I wish I took a pic of the 5.9 variant, totally committing section right off of the ledge.)  Pitch 4 (original 5.8) traverses left, protection available before a leader moves around the arete, but for a second, a fall will be a wild ride (it is a clean traversing fall) out & off of the arete. Then climb up through black rock on good holds. This next section is really wild, face climbing traverse back right on quartz (this is where that 2" white crystal is); just trust the feet, it's all a sequential section. At this point it hits you, this route is a classic. There is a fixed piece that you probably should back up with a cam to preserve its placement due to vectoring of a second fall traversing on this section and the pin is looking not too good. Belay is at a sloping ledge with a fixed pin and gear seam.   (Variant 5.8: natural line climber's right of the arete, this looked good and really sustained. I may have to give this section a go.)  Pitch 5 (original 5.7): climb climber's left of the sloping ledge up cracks & face moves up to a horizontal knife edge.   HOWEVER, right in front of you is an excellent 5.9 slightly overhanging fingers-to-hand crack through a short quartz section. With jugs available to help you escape out of this section (an off-balance move, just do it - also, take a look down over your left shoulder, oh man!). Once at the horizontal knife-edge, do a short leapfrog over to a tree.  Pitch 6 (original 5.7): go down & right about 150' (though this looked like a shorter distance to me) and up a short weakness (R. Rossiter has this at 5.5).   BUT, natural 5.8 line right in front of the tree was my choice. A quick trip to Vedauwoo will prepare you for this pump fest; great hands in a meat grinder with poor feet. This variant looks unappealing but really has some good sustained fist crack moves. Exit & move to find easy slab belay.  (Variant 5.9+/.10a: I didn't climb this variation. From comments received & reading R. Rossiter's description, it may very well be a good variant. This variant is located climber's left of the 5.8 handcrack, taking on the arete crest more directly.)  Pitch 7 (5 nothing): solo, simul, or belay, similar to East Face Flatirons climbing, but on igneous rock (good quality rock also), for a couple hundred feet up & left (then moving climber's right - just follow the easy line). We also saw some minute garnet crystals along the way.   The walk-off will appear and be obvious to the right.  Find a bush, take a leak, & a drink; take it all in you just climbed a classic!!  If I left out/misinterpreted anything on the variants, please comment, I'll go climb it again; it's a fine route. I also went to the AAC Library to research printed history, but not much else was offered other than to say something to the effect that 7 pitches of difficult climbing were accomplished on the FA.  An interesting bit of history printed in the Alpinist 16 from Irene's perspective about this route. If it's a classic, who am I to argue??

route_description: Classic Wind River climb! Incredibly consistent, classic,  sustained (at the grade) backcountry climbing in the west. Classic enough that it made the 50 classicly crowded climbs book, so expect parties to be in the area vying for the early slot. Be prepared to start early anyway to avoid afternoon t-storms that one can't see until they come over the  formation from the southwest. You'll see what the fuss is over, though, with the great views, exposure, and beautiful climbing that every pitch offers. Route finding skills will be put to the test in a couple key locations, and retreat after the first 300 feet will be a challenge.   Head up the 3rd class ramp that heads toward the sloping ledge system, traverse and/or downclimb to reach the ledge, thinking about the 2nd as you place gear. Belay just past the ledge where good pro presents itself in the left leaning ramp that leads to the dihedral with a prominent roof.   Climb the dihedral, either belaying below or after the roof.   Climb a long pitch, starting first right, then back left to a fun 5.8 crack and belay.   Ascend the left leaning system of ledges and dihedral cracks for at least 2 pitches (even with a 60m). The Kelsey topo forgets how long this section is. Going right early will end in a dead end.   Do finally head right with some spaced pro up the ledges until the 5.8 flare and 5.9 3" variation become unmistakable back to the left. Struggle up the flare to easier ground and belay left at the ledge.  Continue leftward, past a large flake and up to belay at the base of a crack leading to a chimney continue up or step again left and continue the crack system to for a long pitch and belay.   Head up to the base of either of two chimney systems. Another pitch up either of the chimney sections leads to the east ledges platform.  Another pitch awaits to the upper summit. Ascend to the top, then make a short rappel to gain the summit proper.  Walk/scramble over then down the 3rd class gully to the south to reach the South Face/K cracks rappels (two ropes recommended) 3 or 4 raps lead to the ledge that heads further left to the South Buttress descent.

parent_name: Wolfs Head 
parent_url: /v/wolfs-head/105848711 
route_description: This route goes up the knife blade east ridge of Wolfs Head.  To get on the ridge there are 2 different options.  IMO the easiest way to gain the ridge is to scramble 4th and 5th class up the gully in between Pingora and Tiger Tower, summit Tiger Tower then do 2 40ft raps on to the east ridge of Wolfs Head (see picture on wolfs head page).  The other way, which I have not done is to scramble 3rd and 4th class up the south face then up to the ridge.  Once on the Ridge the climb goes at about 10 pitches but many of these can be combined or simul-climbed.  The description below is what worked for us.  1.)  Start by moving west along the ridge aiming for a 30ft slab that's about 3ft wide and a 30 degree slope. Scamper across this beautifully exposed bridge(5.5), then run the rope out for 195ft until you find a belay.  (mostly exposed 4th class) 2.)  From here its roughly 3 pitches of easy 3rd and 4th class climbing along the ridge.  This can be easily simul-climbed and highly recommended.  End at a ledge 10ft down to the south (left) of the ridge, just before the first tower.  3.) This is the first of the tower pitches.  Pass this tower to the south by making a exposed step around a boulder.  After this look up and you will see a chimney in between the towers, go through this chimney (tight squeeze) to gain a ledge on the north side of the next tower.  You can belay here, but I recommend to keep climbing to link this pitch with the "piton pitch".  Follow 4 or 5 pitons for some delicate exposed face climbing (5.6).  After the last piton go straight up and belay on the nice ledge.  4.) The best pitch of the climb.  From the belay move straight up the layback flake for 20ft.  Once on top, go up a finger crack for 10 feet to gain a beautiful hand crack traverse 5.6(still on the north).  After the traverse move up to the top of the knife blade ridge for some beautifully exposed climbing.  At this point you should be eye level with the "Darth Vader Tower".  Belay in an overhang on the south side of the ridge under the tower. 5.) From the belay move out on to the south face to traverse a 4in crack.  Going feet in the crack is easier but hard to protect.  You will see a chimney down left, your aiming for this.  Follow a slanting hand traverse using "black nubbins" to gain the chimney.  Climb the chimney until you see a hole that you can dive through to bring you back to the north side of the ridge.  Belay on a ledge on the north side of the ridge.   6.) From here you can simul-climb to the summit staying mainly on the north side of the ridge. (mostly 4th and 5th class)  Descent:  There are many ways to descend, the goal is to rap to the west until you can hike south to the gully in between Wolfs Head and Overhanging tower.  All the raps can be done with one 60m.   All stations contain at least 3 slings.  If your rapping off something with less, you may be off route.1.)  Find the slings on the West side of the summit, rap down 80ft to a ledge. 2.)  Walk 10ft to the west to find another group of slings in a boulder alcove.  Rap 70ft to a ledge. 3.)  Walk to the south west along a climbers trail to locate the next set of slings on your right.  Rap another 90ft to a ledge. 4.)  Carefully scramble down the trail to the next set of slings.  Rap another 95ft to a ledge. 5.)  If my count is right, here you will walk along a trail for about 400yds to the south toward Overhanging tower.  Do another 90ft rap to the saddle in between Wolfs head and Overhanging tower.   6.)  Follow the cairns for a while still heading south.  Eventually this takes you to a station that will allow you to rap into the gully formed by the saddle.  It looks like it should be a double rope rap, but one 60m will be fine.  After rapping scramble up the gully to the east bringing you back into the cirque lake basin.    There are many options, and this may sound confusing, but the trails are well worn and marked with cairns, and all the stations were very easy to find.

route_description: A nice little route with two really nice pitches.  This description is for the 5.8 variation, but the route goes at 5.6 also.  P1: After the 4th class scramble to the start, climb a nice r-facing corner system for a long pitch (maybe some simul climbing is necessary) to a little perch at the foot of a clean wall with a crack that splits.  (5.7, 200ft)  P2: For the 5.6 variation head left to a dihedral.  For the 5.8 variation, head straight up the fine crack (wide to start, then hand/finger) and at the split head left.  This sews up and is the best pitch of the route.  P3: Easy scrambling to the top.

route_description: South Crack is a great climb that begins with several pitches of gradually steepening clean 5.8 finger cracks and then finishes with some rather run out 5.7+ slabs to the summit.  Begin at the southernmost foot of the dome, right of the Great White Book.  Scramble up 4th class ledges and low angle rock towards the obvious crack/flake system until it becomes necessary to belay.  Depending on your comfort level (or willingness to simul), you can eliminate a lot of belays by pushing the approach high.  At the end of the cracks you'll find some wandering, unprotected slabs that lead to the summit.  It may be best to head relatively straight up (easier), or to link small features (pro).

route_description: A long, awkward, wide crack can surprise many 5.6 leaders.  Pro is sparse and hard to place, especially if you don't have some huge pieces (5-6 inches), resulting in long runouts.  But it's a beautiful long line straight up almost to the top of the dome.  P1 and P2 are pretty straightforward 5.6 and easier climbing.  P3 and P4 are the mental crux - try not to get sucked in too deep, keep your feet on the main wall and your back on the right wall.  The angle is low, so if you keep upright, it's trivial, but it probably won't feel like it.  Don't pass up a place to get in some pro these two pitches - you won't find many.  P4 is also poorly protected face climbing, moving left until you hit slabs.

route_description: Ascending the steep, forboding, north face of Drug Dome at a surprisingly easy grade, OZ is a thing of beauty.  Its pitches forge their way upwards to a striking right-facing dihedral and involve much interesting climbing.  I usually pronounce it "ounce" but sometimes I slip and say "Oz."  When I'm feeling posh I say "oh zee."  P1:  Begin at a little flake system well right of the huge dihedral above.  This flake system intersects a low roof.  Some tricky small gear protects this pretty well and gains a long left-angling flake/crack.  Follow this to its apex and belay.  5.10a.  P2:  Perform a tricky move up off the belay, then step left and climb past three bolts and a difficult hand traverse on slopers (crux).  This reaches a rest stance.  There is one more difficult face passage past a few more bolts before the climbing eases.  Climb up cracks and ledges to a belay on a sloping ramp that leads directly into the long corner.  A long pitch, 5.10d.  P3:  Climb the awesome, overhanging thin hands corner.  This pitch is soft for 10c and has many rest stances.  It is steep and amazing however.  Belay below the huge roof that caps Drug Dome.  P4:  Climb out left past a few bolts, around the arete, then up easy terrain to a belay below the summit.  5.9.  Or, better yet, do the Gram Traverse!  Excessive gear for the dihedral really isn't necessary as there are enough constrictions and pods to fit a varity of equipment.  Keep in mind that OZ and Gram can be chilly and windy.

parent_name: Temple Crag 
parent_url: /v/temple-crag/105804351 
route_description: This is a classic long-day alpine route on good rock with some unique features, not least of which is a Tyrolean traverse.  Most people start from an obvious crack in a left-facing dihedral (as seen in Mike Morley's picture here near a big grey scar, some distance (300'? 500'?) from the base of the snowfield and the start of Dark Star.  The main drawback is the descent through Contact Pass, though you could bypass that by traversing to Gayley and Sill...  This route has many variations and it's wise to take a topo unless you've climbed a lot on Temple.  A good topo can be found in Croft's book or the High Sierra Supertopo book (the latter has some errors).  However, Bruce Bindner (R.I.P.) posted a better topo right here; it's the best I've seen and you will appreciate it once on the route.  The rock on the route is overall pretty solid, but there are plenty of loose blocks that could kill you if you got careless.  It would be a good idea to start early (regardless of whether you plan the ascent car-to-car or from a camp site) because Temple is plenty exposed to electrical storms.  When Scott and I climbed the route, a storm blew in after we had passed the crux, my hair stood up, and the rope started making crackling noises... luckily for us the storm changed directions and did not get any nastier.  Check the weather beforehand!

route_description: The West Pillar route is a fun route and a great link-up with a route on Cathedral Peak. When linking these two routes, you effectively make a loop, hiking out on the John Muir trail, instead of the Cathedral Peak approach trail. The first pitch begins with a wide crack (5.9). There are two ways to go on the next section. The original route moves right and climbs 5.9 cracks to a horn in one pitch and climbs back left via 5.7 and 5.8 climbing in the next pitch. A direct route is also possible at 5.10 and is popular. This variation climbs directly above the first pitch belay for two pitches, both 5.10, and meets up with the original route where you can belay on the ridge. The 4th pitch is mostly 3rd class and ledgey with some 5th class terrain. It traverses underneath the ridge proper. The final pitch appeared to have some options but should stay left of the ridge, climbing one section of 5.8 and easier climbing before the summit.

route_description: This is the huge gully on the east face of Laurel Mountain, easily visible from the hot tubs down in Long Valley. The route starts at the Convict Lake parking area. Take the lake trail around the north side of the lake. At the far end of the lake there is a junction, stay straight (right) as the lake trail drops down to the left. After half a mile or so, the trail crosses an old creekbed. You can see it leading up to the gully above to your right. Follow the creekbed to the gully, and proceed up the gully. Depending on season the bottom of the gully may or may not be full of snow. I had to bypass the snow and ice by climbing choss on the gully's right side. Eventually, I was able to come down to the bottom of the gully again. The rock in the bottom of the gully is quite good, blue limestone, very unusual for the sierras. The climbing comes in steps... 20 feet of steep (though always easy) rock, then flat for a while, then another rock step. After a while, the gully steepens but stays easy. It winds to the left and then back to the right again, shooting straight for the summit to the right of a very steep buttress. Eventually the gully opens out onto the scree slopes that lead to the summit proper. Whew! Descebd to the north, then down snow and scree slopes to the east, eventually picking up a faint trail through the brush that leads south back down to Convict Lake. Now buy yourself a beer and go soak in the hot tubs!

route_description: 8-9 pitches in most guidebooks, this route can be done fairly easily in 7 pitches with a 60m rope. Here's how the pitches break down to do it in 7 pitches.  Approach the base of the climb, and scramble up and left on the 4th-class slab to a good ledge below an obvious corner system with a thin-hands crack on the right wall.  Rope up there.  P1: 190' (5.8) Climb the open book with the thin-hands crack to a ledge, then up another open book with a fist crack in the corner.  P2: 185' (5.9) Traverse left across the face, looking for an old piton.  Sparse gear protects the traverse, with the crux move of the pitch dropping down across the chimney.  Cross the chimney and climb the face to the left (small pro).  P3: 70' Climb up loose, easy 5th class to the base of the steep corner.  P4: 185' (5.9) Head straight up the corner stemming and jamming in the finger cracks, then climb the hand crack/chimney above.  P5: 190' Easy 5th class up the ridge. Communication is difficult.  P6: 80' (5.7) Climb up and right to a 5.7 hand crack to a tight tunnel through to the South.  Belay on ledge.  P7: 110' (5.8) Climb the short OW straight up the ridge and follow the ridge to the 5.8 mantel onto the summit block.  Easy to bail out left from the start of this pitch.  Many bail slings exist on the route ranging in quality.  Bring your own bail slings if the weather looks suspicious.  DO NOT bail into the gully to the south as it is a bowling alley of rockfall. Rap directly down the route.

Watch out for more loose rock than usual.  Start the climb up the lefthand gully, uphill from the base of the face. There may be a cairn.  P1-2 5.6. Make a long traverse right and slightly upwards then around onto the face proper.  P3-7 5.7. There's a shallow dihedral up high on the right side of the face; aim for it, but don't go too far right. Pitch 7 finishes with a tricky traverse to a hanging belay at the bottom of the shallow dihedral.  P8 5.8. Climb the shallow dihedral to an alcove.  P9 5.8. Left out of the alcove then wander across and up the white scar to a ledge just below the large summit dihedral.  P10 5.8. A short strenuous corner leads to a ledge at the bottom of the main dihedral.  P11-12 5.8. Two pitches up the summit dihedral lead to a notch.  P13 5.7. Traverse left on a large ledge then up the face to the summit ridge.  Scramble the ridge to the summit.

route_description: A route on solid rock in a magnificent position.  P1 5.4 Climb up a groove, traverse right to a little wall with large knobs, up this to a large ledge; spike belay belay on the right.   P2 5.6 On the righthand edge of the ledge is a corner formed by a detached block, climb this, then up a crack, traverse right around an overlap, climb a crack and switch right into another crack to reach a small ledge in an alcove. Nut belay.   P3 5.6 Climb the wall on the left of the alcove, traverse right along an easy ledge and gain a ramp of different rock, head right up this for 30ft, then climb a crack (small wire) step left and climb a slab to a ledge. Nut belay.  P4 5.6 Climb a crack, then easily right to a chimney crack, up this to a ledge on the right. Climb a beautiful left-facing corner (50 Classics shows Allen Steck on this) to a thinner crack, up this then step right to a small ledge and nut belay below the Slot Pitch.  P5 5.8 Climb The Slot, good holds on the face to the right to a small ledge running across the face. Belay at a crack on the right with nuts. A magnificent pitch.  P6 5.7 Up the crack, with an awkward move right to gain a ledge below a steep wall. Nut belay on the right.  P7 5.7 From the righthand end of the ledge go over 2 small pinnacles and climb up a steep right facing corner to a semi-hanging belay on nuts. A great pitch.  P8 5.7+ A long intricate pitch. Climb the crack that the corner has become until it peters out, ahead looks hopeless, but step left into another crack, nut, head up and left, aiming for a small pocket in the slab above, this pocket takes a 2.5 Friend. Make a delicate step left to a crack, good pro. Step left up a rib to a ledge (wires in diagonal crack on the right), climb a steep step to a crack (TCU), head up this to a ledge, traverse right to a small spike and nut belay.  P9 5.6 The Furrow Pitch. The face above is deeply furrowed with large holds, head up this, aiming for bushes, good pro to start. Soon the protection becomes sparse, head rightwards to a nook overlooking the recess high on the Dome. Thread belay. An exposed pitch.  P10 5.6 The Dick Long Pitch (see 50 Classics). Traverse left over bushes to a steep flake crack, up this in a magnificent position to a huge ledge with a dead tree. Thread (and possible bivi!!)  P11 5.6 Climb the orange face behind the belay directly to another ledge. Thread. A brilliant finish.  P12 Easy climbing leads to the summit ridge.

parent_name: Higher Cathedral Rock 
parent_url: /v/higher-cathedral-rock/105833493 
route_description: The Northeast Buttress of Higher Cathedral Rock has a reputation for being a fantastic climb -- Don Reid refers to it as one of the best grade IV's in the Valley, and SuperTopo raves about its 5-star quality.  Most people I've spoken with who have climbed it enjoyed the route but didn't necessarily go on and on about it.  Personally, I thought the climb was average in quality and less than the spectacular classic it is made out to be.  The NEB has some things going for it: such as a few stand-out pitches (but only a few), very sustained climbing pitch-for-pitch, and a relatively steep line.  Going against it is much less-than-memorable climbing, and of course a pretty lengthy approach and walkoff.  Climb it and decide for yourself.  Follow the standard Higher Cathedral Rock approach.  The NEB is before one arrives at Braille Book -- these two climbs bookend the large, steep, mostly blank east wall of Higher Cathedral.  It begins at a blocky, left-facing corner.  P1: Scramble to the top of the blocks, then trend left to a long right-facing corner of 5.6 cracks.  Belay on a ledge at bolts.  5.6.  P2: Climb a steep 5.8 crack or an ugly slot to the right.  Trend right and then wander up crack systems to a belay by a tree and a weird pillar of rock.  5.6.  P3: Climb 5.8 & 5.9 hands through some roofs and continue up crack systems to a belay on a ledge.  P4: Climb a long, steep left-facing corner through several bulges.  Link this pitch easily into the next one with a long runner.  5.8.  P5: Traverse straight left across an exposed face.  Various gear, some fixed pro, and some bits of downclimbing lead to a bolted belay on a long flake/ledge system.  This pitch is where Mary's Tears crosses the route and continues into the Crucifix.  This is also the halfway point and where the climbing turns physical.  5.8.  P6-8: Climb steep crack systems of all sizes, including ugly squeezes, belaying where necessary, until exiting a 5.8 chimney and belaying to the left at bolts.  The supposed crux pitch is a nice, clean corner protected with a few pins.  Not too bad compared to the steep squeezes and OW on other parts of the climb.  5.9.  P9: Traverse left past a beautiful looking fist crack in a right-facing corner, downclimb a bit, then continue left to easier flakes and tree climbing.  Belay here, or if you runner things very well it is possible to link to the next pitch.  5.9.  P10: Climb up the crack system to a belay at a tree.  5.8.  P11: Perhaps the true crux of the climb.  Continue up very steep, awkward cracks to a face traverse to an obvious tree out left.  Runner your gear well, and launch up from the tree to a strenuous, possibly unprotected, 5.8 squeeze to a dirty mantle to the top.  5.8+.  Descend towards the top of Braille Book, continue past it and down the saddle to the east, eventually some manzanita tunnelling will return you to your packs.

route_description: Excellent rock, incredible exposure, high elevation, and panoramic views earn this the deserved status of one of the 100 best alpine climbs named in John Moynier and Claude Fiddler's "Sierra Classics".  I'm sure this has been done many times car-to-car by parties stronger than mine, but most will opt for at least one overnight at either Iceberg or Upper Boyscout Lakes to acclimatize and enjoy the surroundings.  Consider combining with one of the Whitney routes (East Face, East Buttress) by camping an extra night at Iceberg.  The route itself is roughly 8 pitches, and follows a sharp crescent-shaped spine on the southern aspect of the peak.  The start is a bit ambiguous, so just follow the path of least resistance for a pitch or so to gain the ridge proper.  Continue along the ridge for several more pitches.  At one point, you'll have to downclimb about 15' to a prominent notch.  The pitch above the notch is the money pitch, on impeccable golden rock.  Continue for several more pitches, staying on the spine for full value.  From the summit, descend via the East Ridge.  This will take you back to Upper Boy Scout Lake.  Choose another descent option if you left gear at Iceberg Lake.  Allow *roughly* 6 hours from base to summit.  Allow roughly 5 additional hours to descend from the summit back to the car at Whitney Portal.

route_description: The premier moderate route in the Whitney Area.  Day 1 Hike to Iceberg Lake. Day 2 Do climb. Day 3 Hike back to Whitney Portal.  Eleven fairly consistent pitches on excellent rock.  The route starts up a scree slope where you head to left-facing corner on the right side of the "second tower", which is directly on the east buttress.  It's pretty easy to stay on route - don't stray far from the true buttress.  If it's obviously harder than 5.7, look around and get back on route.  p1. Easy climbing up the corner. 5.5-5.6 p2. Nice face climbing. 5.6-5.7. p3-5.  wander around the buttress taking whatever line looks best.  Head for the left side of "the peewee" - a huge roof/block that looks rather ominous.  4th-5.6 p6. up the left side of the peewee.  usually dark and cold.  Feels good to get on top of it.  5.6 p7-11. cracks and blocks that generally trend left.  The more left you go, the sooner you'll hit a talus field and start walking to the top.  Climbing stays easy right on the buttress, with a few boulder problems to overcome.  Top out, dazzle the crowd that hiked up the Whitney Trail and listen to their cell phone calls (golly gee honey - you won't believe where I'm calling from...).

parent_name: Washington Column 
parent_url: /v/washington-column/105833399 
route_description: The South Face of the Column is the first wall experience for a lot of aspiring big wall climbers in the Valley. A few pitches of free climbing and easy aid make it a straight-forward, two-day climb for most teams. Bear in mind that this also makes this route the BUSIEST wall route in the entire Valley.  The general approach is to climb to Dinner Ledge the first day, fix a couple of pitches from there, then head for the top on day two.  P1) Climb up 5.8 corner, traverse out across the slab left of the corner and belay on a ledge at the top.  P2) Go left across to the first nice corner and aid that to the anchor. There is a free-climbable (10b) corner left of that, but don't go too far or the climbing will get way hard and you'll have to penji back right to the anchors at the top.  P3) Free climb up cracks and corners to the right end of Dinner Ledge. The good bivy spots are all out to the left below the Kor Roof.  P4) Kor Roof pitch. Easy free climbing up a ramp takes you to bolts. Aid bolt-to-bolt up the roof to a crack that leads up and right. Aid this crack to belay anchors. MAKE SURE NOT TO BACK CLEAN TOO MUCH IN THIS CRACK OR YOUR SECOND WILL KILL YOU UPON ARRIVAL AT THE BELAY!  P5) Crux pitch. Head up and over the small roof above the belay. A tricky move into the crack above, then continue aiding up the left along the arch. A short penji will get you to the anchor.  P6) Continue aiding up and left, then up crack to anchor.  P7) All time stopper pitch! Nuts are bomber here. Go straight up cracks to the anchor.  P8) This pitch is free-climbable at 5.9.  Climb up and cut right to chimney. Continue up to a belay in the chimney above.  P9) Tricky pitch of mixed free climbing and aid goes out right and up from the chimney, then up some more to belay in a big tree. Nice!  P10) Hardest free climbing pitch here, or aidable up and over roof back left to belay.  P11) Go up loose gully taking care not to dump tons of death on the parties below. Belay off tree above. Carry the haul bag!!!  Yer done! Scramble to the top of the Column from there, pack up and descend the North Dome Gully. Do a little research on this to suss the line of the descent.

parent_name: Castleton Tower 
parent_url: /v/castleton-tower/105716850 
route_description: This is one of the earliest modern desert routes, it was the first on this 6656 foot tower, and it was put up by the dynamic duo of astrophysicist, Huntley Ingalls. and the incomparable Layton Kor in September of 1961.  Arriving in the valley before their friends Fred Beckey and Harvey Carter, they started up the route on a reconnaissance, climbed a 100 foot pitch, continued with a more challenging pitch requiring some aid climbing, and rappelled.  The next day they mixed aid and offwidth/chimney techniques as they ascended the third pitch.  The crux required two bolts for aid climbing.  Interestingly, when Californians Chuck Pratt and Steve Roper made the second ascent in 1963, they found many pieces of lumber strewn about the summit.  Perplexed, they considered various explanations that did not add up.  Suddenly, they realized that there had been an advertisement with a car and a shapely model on a desert summit for which they had built a wooden platform.  Who would have thought?  In contrast to many desert routes, this climb utilizes calcite-coated Wingate sandstone for much of the route.  This means the rock will seem stronger than average in strength; however, this also means it will be slick in spots due to polished calcite.  It is of the utmost importance that you bring a gym/sport climber with you to follow you on this routes, especially if they are European.  Doing this will make this route an even more memorable experience.  Trust me.  Additionally, do the route in the winter.  You can get 1/2 price motel rooms in Moab and the crowds won't be there.  To reach the route, follow the directions to Castleton Tower.  Take the new trail and head to the left (North) side of the tower to bypass the short cliff band.  It should be noted that this cliff band is fun to down-climb in the dark, so you may not want to miss it.  After bouldering up a short, exposed bit, head left towards the route - a big, fat dihedral on the South side as you approach the tower.  P1 - this is a 140 foot, 5.easy pitch that splits into 4 sections.  It starts at a wide dihedral crack/chimney system, goes up about 20 feet to a big ledge and continues past a bulge.  Head slightly left to a fat dihedral/squeeze chimney that puts you onto another almost as big ledge (2 bolt rap anchor on the right).  Continue up another short chimney to a belay at yet another big ledge (gear anchor). 5.6, 140'.  P2 - head up the obvious crack system.  It is weird and is more or less a double crack system.  After ~20', the left crack goes up past a bolt and continues as Black Sun.  The right crack is the original line; however, you could continue up Black Sun a bit further and angle right later.  You'll figure-out how to do it.  Double #4 Camalots and a bit of leap-frogging can make this more reasonable.  Note, face climb around some large, loose blocks in the last 25' of this pitch.  Be very careful with these, they shift.  This pitch also takes a couple of bomber medium to large stoppers towards the top.  At the end of this pitch, you will be placed at a ledge with a bolted belay.  Oh yeah, it's honest 5.8, 100'.  P3 - this is the business (true 5.9).  Most of it is wide, but most of the protection is not.  All I can say is don't get tunnel vision at the crux, which has the 3rd bolt near it.  If you are a runt like me, you can squeeze into the chimney after the crux and feel secure.  If not, there are face climbing options on polished calcite.  There are protection options deep in the chimney.  This pitch is where I got to hear my German friend curse in two languages - it was awesome.  You arrive at a 3 bolt anchor.  5.9, 3 updated protection bolts & gear, 110'.  P4 - you can either do 5.7 face with a hand or foot traverse right or the 5.similar chimney to the left.  Definitely do the chimney if someone in your party is not a trad climber.  You can easily watch them flail. This pitch is not too long compared to the 2nd and 3rd.  There is a 2 bolt anchor just below the summit.  You'll have to pee by now, so go ahead and get on the summit (on belay of course).  5.8, 80'.  The route does go into the shade mid to late afternoon.  It can be blazing hot in the quiet sun to unpredictably cold in the shade and wind, so be prepared.  This route can be incredibly popular with even foreigners queuing up.  Fortunately, you can descend from most points quite easily.  We descended this thing in 3 raps.  From the top anchor, rap to the end of the 2nd pitch (2 ropes).  From there, go to the top of the 1st pitch.  Then it's 90' to the start.  You can rap this route with a 70m rope in 4 rappels (80', 105', 140' (with a short belayed downclimb), 90').  You can also rap the North Face in 3 rappels with double ropes.  Note:  You can and should back-up every belay.  Also, there is calcite all up and down this route.  I hate calcite - except for one place where you agree with me.

route_description: This route will restore your respect for the ratings.  After thrashing up this offwidth, I felt like I was going to puke.  The bottom twenty feet is thin hands, followed by a chimney so narrow that I was only able to squeeze through by clipping my chalk bag and all gear to my side and taking off my helmet.  This way is pretty claustrophobic, so unless you weigh less than about 120 pounds I wouldn't recommend it! It's probably better to lieback this wide section.  A rest is available after coming out of the chimney, and is followed by another offwidth section that's 5 or 6 inches wide.  This section will require at least 3 large pieces: possibly a 4.5 camalot, #5 camalots, and at least one bigger piece like a #6 friend or a big-bro.  Enjoy!

route_description: Pharaoh's Beard is a small exfoliation flake propped up against the Sentinel Creek Wall. It is located a couple hundred yards uphill and to the right of Manana. The Regular Route is a historic climb that doesn't get done much these days. Like most climbs at Sentinel Creek it's in the shade until the afternoon, and the second half of the route is always in the shade.  The route begins on the right side of the formation. Jam your way up easy flakes to reach a tree. Monkey your way through the tree and climb a fun clean offwidth to a ledge with an old piton anchor.  The next pitch climbs the right side of a flake and then you step left into a corner. Move to the left side of Pharaoh's Beard and climb some chossy flakes to a tree. You can belay here if you want or link this with the 3rd pitch if the rope drag's not too bad.  Claw your way through the tree (this one's much more difficult than the first) and enter a chimney. Pass a chockstone and then tunnel up behind the last portion of the formation to the summit.  Rappel the route with one 70m rope. The summit anchors are new bolts. The rap station at the top of pitch 1 belongs in a museum and consists of a 1/4" bolt, 2 pitons (all over 50 years old!) and a fixed nut that I added in 2011.

Pitch 2) Continue up the chimney, also a crux, and jam your way to the platform and the belay bolts.   This climb can be done in one long pitch if desired  but most do it in two.  The flat ledge at the top is an awesome place to hang out for a while.  It also is the first belay for The Hand Me Down .10a   Rappel with two ropes.

Offwidth up this, can be strenuous, reaching the upper chimney. This chimney is more difficult than 5.7 and there is a delicate set of moves to get up and over left to the belay bolts.

Approach by walking up and right from the toe of Lower Brother, taking a left at the first major ramp system.  From here 250 feet of scrambling (some 4th or maybe easy 5th) will take you to the base of the route.  P1: Two options, a 5.7 exciting chimney or a 5.9 flake, we took the chimney and weren't disappointed.  Belay at the highest ledge at the base of a perfect thin hands splitter.  P2: Climb the excellent splitter.  Pass an old bolt casing (optional belay) and continue up the left facing corner.  Lots of hands to off hands with an awkward bulge/horn to pass on this part of the pitch.  Belay at a nice ledge with trees after 175 feet.  P3: Again a couple options; we continued up the most logical line, the groove to OW corner.  The intimidating OW above isn't too bad with lieback techniques and a 5" piece.  Continue with the chimney above and belay on another comfortable ledge.

route_description: This is a route of high quality with all sorts of jams from finger locks to fists and knob tie-offs.  I would point anyone who is a crack lover to this climb.  It is also considered the warm-up climb for the area, although, it really is a little steep and stiff for this consideration.  Many climbers feel Chicken Pie is deserving of a .10a grade.  This is understandable since Chicken Pie is one of the more demanding 5.9 finger to hand cracks.  The overall quality of this climb is comparable to the best cracks you will find down canyon.  Also, if you have repeatedly climbed pitch one of Chicken Pie, I would recommend you give the knobby pitch two top out a try.  From the chains, pitch two heads right and up large knobs.  The pro is good on the entire route, and can easily be done in one pitch if mindful of rope drag.

route_description: Nutcracker is one of the most popular routes in Yosemite. Rarely can one hike to the climb and not find a number of parties on the route. Having said that, it's an excellent route, with clean cracks, good protection and fine climbing!  P1) There are two possible starts. The original, starts up a sort of gully-crack system, heading for a belay above. A 5.9 variation goes up the cool-looking (but seriously slippery!) finger crack that angles right, then up.  P2) Head up a sort of low-angle chimney-crack system and belay above.  P3) Step right to gain a nice crack running up the wall. Climb this to a stance below an overhang above.  P4) Traverse left across to near a tree, then follow the crack to a belay below the infamous mantle move.  P5) Climb up to the corner system above and execute the infamous "mantle move". Continue above in a nice crack that takes you to a flat summit. My personal feeling is that the reputation of this move is a bit overrated. The holds are pretty big and it's over quickly. There are two reasons to make dang sure not to fall, however; the fall would suck and I don't recall the pro placement being completely bomber. Ankles have been shattered on this pitch! Be careful!  Descent: Scramble down off the back-left of the formation and down the gully back to the base.

route_description: About 30 feet up the hill and left of Sherrie's Crack is an obvious chimney. This is the start of Gilligan's Chicken. Few people will find this route enjoyable, but for those seeking an easy romp up a chimney and gully, this makes for a decent adventure.  Begin up an awkward offwidth groove to get into the chimney proper. I thought this start was the crux of the whole route. It protects with a big cam if you're worried about falling on your ass. The chimney is easy and secure. Big gear protects the back of it but the rope will drag over some precariously wedged chock-stones at the top of the chimney. I thought it safer to just solo the chimney (about 5.4) and have nothing to do with those chock-stones. Make some cool moves exiting the chimney onto a ledge and belay here, or if you didn't place gear in the chimney you can continue to the top in one pitch.  The second pitch continues up the dirty groove and takes pretty good pro. There are some cool knobs out on the face to the right near the end. Pass by a large tree with rap slings on it (the tree isn't looking too healthy) and continue up to the top of the buttress. Belay on a good ledge and walk off to the left down a 3rd class gully.

route_description: A short, but powerful route. Start on either side of the triangular flake (left side is easy but sparse pro) up to a finger crack. Work left and crank through a small roof (crux). Continue up splitter hand crack (have those gold camalots ready!), make a fun move right, and continue up to the top. Belay from tree.  Walk off left.  If not up for leading, it would be easy to rig a top-rope off a tree by scrambling up and left from the base of the route.  There is also a fun 10b variation that can be led or top-roped. From the base, climb the left side of the triangular flake, traversing left and then back right around a flake resembling the state of Texas. After working back to the right, join up with the main route. If top-roping, a directional is recommended to prevent a big swing from the left end of the "Texas flake".

So if you want to try out a 5.10 ow in Yosemite, throw on a toprope and commence struggling.  Most people Ive talked to seem to think the bottom section is the crux but I dont think its too bad if you have some basic leavitation technique.  Transitioning into the squeeze up higher however, is a grunt any way I know to do it.

route_description: This was originally a practice aid route and was initially freed in 1967 by Lloyd Price et al. There are conflicting accounts, but some claim this was the first 5.11 pitch freed in the Valley. Although current guides give it .11b, it was rated .11a in the 1982 guide, and rated .10d by Bridwell in his seminal article "Brave New World" published in Mountain #31 in 1973. Either way, it was an early example of freeing old aid lines and was at the outer edge of difficulty when it was freed. I've seen this route shut down more than one "5.12" sport climbers.  The business starts right away with a fingery crux on shallow boxy pins scars to a long reach to gain a small flake, then a jug out right. This initial section is bolt protected. Once through the crux, the easy pin-scarred, right trending crack continues to a bolt anchor/rap station at half height. Above this, the second pitch is fingers in pin scars with the occasional hand jam. A short .10a crux reaching between pin scars is encountered near the top. The climb can be done in a single pitch with a 60m (barely).  If you are not up to the boulder problem start, it's worth yarding through on bolts to climb the crack. Otherwise, careful footwork and finger strength will see you through. Having a long reach doesn't hurt either.

In the Sierra Club's mountaineering journal, Ascent, 1973, Jim Bridwell proposed adding letter grades to YDS 5.10's.

route_description: The two pinnacles for which this cliff is named are rarely climbed due to the difficult approach and their lack of visibility from the base of the cliff. Pat Pinnacle is technically 2 pitches and 5.7, but the approach will likely require you to rope up for several more pitches and climb terrain up to 5.9.  Approach option 1: Climb Nurdle (or one of the routes near it). At the top of the second pitch you have a couple 4th class options leading up to the base of the pinnacle. There are also a couple new bolts protecting a short section of face climbing (5.10-) up and right of the anchors which will avoid a bit of bushwhacking. At the base of the pinnacle there are a couple options. There is a left-leaning flake called The Knife (5.11b). There is also a 5.9 to the left which gradually widens from thin to offwidth and has a rope fixed at the bottom. The Knife looked too hard, and the 5.9 had a thick trail of ants marching all the way down the crack, so we opted to scramble down and right to link up with approach option 2.  Approach option 2: Climb Desperate Straights. At the top of the second pitch is a steep and loose gully. This gully will link up with approach option 1 if you wish to climb one of those routes. Otherwise, climb the face up and left of the Desperate Straights anchors. There are a series of small ledges making it go at easy 5th class. Once you're on the ramp traverse left a ways to reach a right facing corner with a wide hands crack in it. This section is a little dirty but otherwise pretty fun. At the top of the crack it's more 4th class with plenty of steep bushwhacking to reach the base of the route.  Approach option 3: This is sort of a theoretical approach, as I have never done it. I'm assuming this approach exists because the previous two options all involve climbing routes that had not been climbed until many years after the first ascent of Pat Pinnacle. Hike up the hill past Sherrie's Crack et al. On the far left side of this buttress, the topo in the Reid guide shows a 3rd class gully leading up to the base of the pinnacle. Be aware that "3rd class" is maybe the most sandbagged grade in Yosemite, and rope up as needed. From here I really have no idea which way the first ascent went. The hand crack near the right end of this ledge system (see approach option 2) goes at only 5.7 or 5.8 depending on the size of your mitts. Or perhaps they aided the thin 5.9 crack (see approach option 1) directly up the wall.  The Climb  Pitch 1 (5.7, 80 ft): If you did one of the approaches correctly, you should be looking up at a flared squeeze chimney on the right side of the pinnacle. This is your route. Just to the right of the chimney are some various other cracks and flakes with a big tree growing out of them about 60 feet up. These cracks go at about 5.10 and can be used as a direct start to Jack Pinnacle, or to access a 5.11a thin crack called Flailing Dog.  So up the chimney you go. The crux is a tight section right off the deck. Luckily there are some good holds on the face which keep the climbing in the 5.7 range. It's really "old school" 5.7 though. A #6 Camalot, or the equivalent, protects the crux pretty well. There is also an ancient bolt which isn't worth clipping, but a fun look into the history of our sport. The chimney is nice and secure once you're in it. It gets more flared about half way up and you can stick a sort of under-cammed #5 in the back if you want. There is a ledge near the top with a roof above. There's some more options for small gear here too. You want to chimney out and around the roof/chockstones. You should finish the pitch above your belayer's head, don't tunnel through to the other side of the formation. The belay ledge is big and flat with 2 new bolts. It's also in the shade most of the day which makes it an ideal place to hang out on warmer days.  Pitch 2 (5.7, 50 ft): Pat Pinnacle is the shorter one in front of Jack Pinnacle. You want to chimney up the notch a short ways and then climb the northwest face of the pinnacle past two shiny new bolts and a newly replaced anchor.  Descent  From the ledge at the notch (top of pitch 1), rappel down the south-east face of Pat Pinnacle. Either rappel to some trees to the right or swing out left to another bolted anchor. From the bolted anchor it's a 35 meter rap to the ledge at the base of the pinnacle. Once on the ledge you can either rappel off some trees heading back down towards Knob Job and Nurdle, or scramble down the gully to the right to reach the anchors atop Desperate Straights. Either way be very careful to not send any loose rocks flying down towards the often crowded cliffs below. You can also reverse the 3rd class gully to the left (see approach option 3) if you came up that way and didn't find it too miserable.

If doing the upper pitches, take two ropes to rap. The first pitch starts with a somewhat slippery 5.7 lieback section to easy low angle jamming, ~75 feet. Belay on gear in cracks directly below the second pitch, or move way right to the rap station at a bay tree. Belay takes nuts, small TCUs, and cams from 1.25" to 3". Second pitch starts perfect hands up and around the roof and thins to 1.25" as the angle kicks back, ~75 feet, bolted anchor.

Rap here or continue up another double crack system with a few laybacks and near chimney moves until you come to the true chimney.  A few easier moves and you are at a ledge with two old 1/4" bolts and a large flake to rap from.  Lancelot can also be TR'ed from here.  I may not make it sound too fun, but its certainly a fun deviation.

route_description: The regular route up the Iota is a fun chimney climb. This combined with The Deer Route and The Remnant-Right Side makes for a great circuit of spelunking adventures. The start is approached by scrambling up and around the left side of the Iota. Here you will enter into a great chimney which divides the Iota from the main wall. Crossroads is a bolted 5.13 face which can be found in this chimney.  Start with a boulder problem and mantel to get into a tunnel which leads out onto the face and the top of Chingando (this is also how you can access a TR setup for Chingando). Climb straight up the obvious chimney to the top. There's not any pro.  To get down, either rappel from slings, or walk to the back left side of the Iota and make a short steep downclimb (there should be a fixed rope with knots tied in it that you can "batman" down).

route_description: The technical crux on this one is the .7 squeeze (very secure). The mental crux is pitch two.  It is reminiscent of the top of Chingando (cavernous).    All climbers should try some Chuck Pratt routes, and this is an easier one.  A favorite among Yosemite obscurity lovers.

route_description: A good pitch which is in your face right off the ground.  Fingers, tight hands, hands, liebacks, body language all required at some point.  Crux is low, but the entire first half of the route is sustained at the grade.  A proud send, put up by two collosal figures in Yosemite's golden age, when 5.9 was a whole different concept.  A variation, also 5.9, takes the thin flake right of the crack.  Not sure about quality of pro in this flake.

route_description: This is my favorite of the "Doggie" climbs. Chimney up 40 ft to a small ledge and then cast off on the long right-leaning offwidth crack. The climbing is physical and awkward but still manages to be enjoyable thanks to the excellent rock quality and great exposure. There is an occasional knob below the crack for you to stand on and catch your breath. It shares the same tree anchor as Doggie Deviations, which can easily be toproped after leading this one.  The offwidth requires several larger cams if you want to protect it. These are a pain to haul up the short squeeze chimney at the start. The easiest way to do this is scramble to the top of the chimney from the left side (3rd class) and leave the gear on the ledge. Then you're free to solo up the 5.6 chimney unencumbered, pick up your rack at the top, and continue on with the rest of the climb.

After the tree ascend another 80 feet to join the original route at the start of the fourth pitch.  The start of the variation takes you up 15 feet of an unprotected slab. Then sink a couple small cams and climb up the smooth 5.9 face. After 20 feet the climbing eases.

It will make you feel what it's like to be a nut jammed in a perfect constriction.  On the final pitch, once you're on the sloping ledge, don't continue up left, but traverse right onto easier ground.  You could do the last two pitches (tunnel and 5.9 hands) after topping out on Reed's Direct, if you were so inclined.

route_description: This is by far the most popular route in the Fisher Towers, and a moderate classic.  The route goes at 5.9 A0 if yarding on bolts, or can be free climbed at well protected 5.10.  P1.  Climb easy 5.4 broken rock to a huge ledge.  If you are free climbing the route, belay here to avoid rope drag.  Climb a 4 bolt ladder to a big belay ledge at the base of a chimney. 5.10, 120 feet.  P2.  Climb a really fun and well protected 5.8 mud chimney for about 90 feet to a belay on the right.  P3.  Climb a short steep crack to a 3 bolt ladder.  5.7 A0 or 5.10, 40 feet.  P4.  This is one of the coolest pitches in the desert.  Walk 20 feet along the sidewalk(narrow extremely exposed ledge).  Mantle awkwardly onto the diving board, and walk to the base of the corkscrew.  Clip 4 bolts/drilled angles en route to the summit.  To descend, lower back to the diving board, and reverse the sidewalk.2 single rope raps lead to the top of pitch 1, and then make a double rope rap to the ground.

route_description: This route is, well, super.  Climb up the side of the detached flake (1.5 or 2 Friend) through the awkward crux (maybe 10c) to a top-of-the-flake ledge right below the crack.  Although decent gear is available, groundfalls have occurred here, so heads-up.  Climb the crack (sustained 5.9) for 80 feet, past the roof to a bolted anchor.  While I typically don't like to give away the detailed beta, I'll make an exception here:  hand jam, foot jam, hand jam, foot jam ...  The crack widens a bit for the last 15 feet, so depending on the size of your mitts, you may have to revise this beta to include a cupped hand or two, and maybe even a fist.   A 60m rope will just barely reach from the anchor for the rappel/TR.  While it probably goes without saying, TR through draws and not the anchor.

route_description: A beautiful fun route, and the easiest crack system on Supercrack Buttress.  There's a good bit of liebacking on the smaller crack and then jamming and laddering on the wider to good anchors 40' up.  It's not a classic and hence usually open; well worthwhile for climbing as a moderate on the buttress or while waiting for other climbs on the north end.    Climb up the main trail to Incredible Hand Crack and head N (left) about 80'.  If you hit a leaning pillar at 130', you've gone about 40' too far - head back past a large bush.  The little crack is in a right-facing dihedral, and the larger crack becomes the primary about 20' up.  Good anchors, good toprope or something to play on when you're waiting or pumped from more serious endeavours.  It's a very good route, but only rates 2 stars because of the stellar stuff surrounding it.

route_description:  As described in the Donnelly Canyon intro, this route is quite obvious.  On my first visit to the area, I said, "That must be Supercrack."  I was wrong, but this is one striking line.  From the parking lot, cross the drainage and head up canyon about 50 yards, then follow an obvious and well built trail up and left to the bottom of the route.    The first pitch is 120 feet long so don't forget the trail line.  The first 25 feet or so are the awkward crux of the route, then you're in hand jam heaven.  The crack does widen slightly near the anchor.  The #4 Camalot is for the obvious pod at the bottom, you could get by without it with a big-hands piece a little lower.  Have fun, and don't forget to keep your weight on your feet, no matter how much they hurt.  The route has a wider second pitch that I've never seen anyone climb.

route_description: From Generic Crack, walk about 60' to the left.  There you will see a huge flake in a left-facing corner.  This flake forms a tips-crack on the right, and a finger-to-hand crack on the left side.  A double chain anchor is 35' off the ground, just above the top of the flake.  A single bolt and ring are above the right hand side, to serve as a directional to protect the fingertips varaition (5.11+, TR)  P1: Climb to the top of this flake (5.9) fromt he left, with good protection and simple, but powerful moves.  P2: Climb up the corner, in  agreat and solid tight-hands crack.  This starts as a 2-2.5" crack for a bit, the eases up to really good hands for a few moves.  After a few more moves, the climb drastically changes its nature.  The corner becomes softer rock (but still safe) and turns into a "double-inset" up above.  This is like having 2 aretes facing nose-to-nose with 12" in between and a chunk of rock some distance behind.  The fun part may be the shenanigans you pull to achieve one no-hands rest after another, by heal-toe, knee-bar, or other odd modes, using the hollow area back in the corner for these positions.  Once past the steepest part of the rock, smaller cams are more useful than large ones (1-1.5").  No OW gear is necessary.  A beginning leader may likely find the distance between a few of the pieces disconcerting when combined with the odd positions of theis route, and as a result will tunnel back in to chimney the moves.  That's no fun, so let it all hang out and enjoy it!!!

This is the crux, then its easy ground up and right to the summit.  Be quick, efficient, and be careful of your rope - watch rockfall, for your team and others.

route_description: Fantastic moderate put up in 1954 by Batso and friends.  The East Butt of Middle is a mandatory route for those looking to bag one of the fifty classics or for people just looking to get some great views of El Cap from across the valley. Mostly 5.6-5.8, this route ascends the springtime shadow line on the buttress.  With an A0 section on the 5th pitch that can be climbed at 10c (slabby but well protected), this route offers a few variations above for those wanting to climb it numerous times or for when it is high season and you may need to pass folks.     The approach is easy, but steep.  The descent can be the crux in the early season due to snow in the gully.  Other than that it is classic, aesthetic, accessible and fun.  Enjoy.

route_description: Central Pillar of Frenzy is a super-popular line up the obvious pillar on the lefthand side of Middle Cathedral's northeast face.  There are almost always several parties on, or in line for, this climb because of it's excellent, though perhaps never outstanding, five pitches of sustained crack climbing.  The climb is actually nine pitches, but does anyone bother with the last four?    P1:  Begin in a right-facing corner on the right side of the pillar.  Climb this slick corner to a final difficult move pulling onto the pillar itself.  Belay at bolts.  This pitch is the crux and is 5.9.  P2:  Head left and up a great 5.9 finger crack system to another bolted belay.    P3:  Continue up through a 5.8 roof and then up a 5.8 OW to another belay.  This pitch and the next are probably the best on the route -- save a bigger cam for above the roof.   P4:  Climb sweet twin cracks up to another bolted belay.  5.8.  P5:  Continue up one more pitch (beginning with a chimney) of nice cracks to a final belay.  5.9.  Rap with double ropes down across the face (not over the route) to climber's left.  Another double rope rappel brings you to an anchor on the left-hand arete of the pillar, over Bircheff-Williams (The Great Wazoo belay).  Continue with double rope raps down the left-facing corner on the left side of the pillar.  Do not leave food in your packs -- the bears know.

route_description: P1: .10d pin scars and fingers right off the notch (easy for the rating, some fixed gear, short crux) to easier climbing to more fixed gear and a stance below an awkward slightly bulging, grainy, and flaring .10a fist/OW for a few moves to a belay on a huge ledge.   P2: Move left off the ledge using a couple of small pieces to a large flat edge than can be hooked or bust a psuedo-free 5.8ish move to get the next placement. A few placements interspersed with bolts/rivets (both with and without hangers..take some small wires or rivet hangers) leads to a full-on bolt ladder than ends as the angle kicks back about 15' below the top. Step out of the aiders and fight the rope drag on the dead easy slab that will feel harder with the drag.   Or, free it at 5.12b, stopping to belay halfway up this pitch after it stops traversing left to cut down the rope drag.   Terrific position and novelty make this a must do. The climbing itself is largely forgettable.

route_description: Venusian Blind is another of the great, adventurous arete climbs on Temple Crag. Depending on your climbing tastes and personal experience on the route, this may be a dream climb or a nervous adventure bordering on epic. For my wife and I, it was a little of both as a 3 foot square block she was standing on ripped off the wall while leading the first roped pitch, nearly bringing a quick demise to both of us.   Venusian shares the start with Moon Goddess Arete, thus making it a good alternative if there are already parties on Moon Goddess. As seen in photos, there is one snow chute that is longer and splits the wall between Sun Ribbon Arete and Moon Goddess Arete. Climb this snowfield to a snow and rock traverse to gain the base of Venusian and Moon Goddess. The snowfield is steep enough to warrant crampons or the proper snow conditions and experience for competent parties without crampons.   Approximately 300 feet of 3rd and 4th class climbing will take you to a series of ledges where the wall steepens. It's on this terrain that Moon Goddess splits off right and Venusian goes up left. The beginning of the route is marked by a short, right facing corner where most will want to rope up.   From here the climb ascends the arete for several pitches, sometimes climbing left or right from the arete proper. Depending on rope length and how you piece pitches together, it seems you can do this route in as few as five or six pitches with some simul-climbing, or up to 11 pitches from the end of the 3rd and 4th class climbing.   There appeared to be many options and even with careful scrutiny of the topo, we found ourselves off route, but never in dangerous climbing or difficulty. There are a couple of impasses of note. First, if done pitch by pitch according to SuperTopo, you can go left or right around the arete on pitch 7. Left is reportedly the best way but we went right because it seemed more obvious and it was clean and straight forward. At the 10th pitch, you top out on a small tower and then encounter a 25 foot traverse across a notch with no protection on precariously stacked blocks. A short downclimb is required to get into the notch. On the other side of the notch is a pitch with a couple of fixed pins, thus providing assurance that you're on route. At the top of this pitch is a hidden anchor on the left side of the arete, facing the gully. You can rappel 60 feeet from here into the gully and climb 3rd and 4th class for 20 minutes to the summit plateau. Or, you can continue on the arete for a few more pitches to the top.   To descend, go east on a climbers' trail towards Contact Pass. The trail eventually turns into 3rd class above the pass and then steepens to 4th and 5th class where most climbers rappel 80 feet from slings to the pass. From here, rock slide and glissade back to the lakes.   Overall, this route seemed relatively quick and easy. Alpine rock climbing skills including route-finding ability, being comfortable on fragile rock and the ability to move fast are probably necessary. Hence, it's not the first alpine climb you would want to go on but it's a worthy outing for an experienced rock alpinist.

Scramble up for a few hundred feet to where the rock gets steeper; rope up here. Several moderate pitches lead to the first impasse, a gendarme which is bypassed on the right with a super-exposed traverse (5.7). Climb down to the base of the Ibrium Tower. A cracks lead to a platform and the second impasse below the flawless section of the Tower (5.8). Pass around to the right, very exposed, and continue to traverse (loose in parts) until cracks lead back to the top of the Tower (5.8). Continue to follow the crest of the ridge, tackling impasses (5.7 or so) until the easy back slopes of Temple Crag are reached. Hike to the summit if there's time - it's worth the view.

route_description: Approach Time: 2-3 hours Descent Time: 2-3 hours Time to climb the route: 3-6 hours Sun Exposure: sunrise to late afternoon Height of route: ~500', length 1/2 mile to North Summit or 0.8 miles to the end.  Generally, people do the traverse from South to North. This is because the crest slopes upwards in that direction and therefore you will end up at a higher elevation. Doing it North to South would involve more downclimbing.  Probably best to Simul or Solo much of the route.  To rope up for every single pitch would take a horrendous amount of time.  Start the climb at the South face above a patch of pine trees and stay a bit left. The climbing is <5.6 here and climbs very textured / featured rock upwards onto the ridge. Follow the path of least resistance. Once on the crest itself, just follow it along. When in doubt, check out both sides of the crest and traverse along the easier one. The crux of the climb comes on the left side (West) of the crest directly below the South Summit. Strenuous and physical climbing up a good crack leads to easier climbing and then the summit. Sign the register.  From the South Summit: Do not rap, but rather climb back down the ridgetop for 100' and traverse past on easy ledges on the East side of the South Summit. Trying to rap often results in snagged ropes here. OR Simply continue the travers and downclimb the next section, placing pro for the follower.  From the North Summit: Many parties stop here and rappel off the crest (2 double length rappels on the West side). There are many rap stations that appear so bring some webbing in case the stations need new webbing.  Continuing the climb offers great climbing, but the climbing difficulty increases so it is recommended you be solid at the grade.  I'd say some of the downclimbing was 5.8.  Retreat: It is probably best to bail off the West side at just about any point.  There appear to be many rap stations at random intervals on the face.  Multiple short rappels are best.  Be prepared to leave slings and or gear.

Tunnel through to the other side of the ridge.  To finish, join with the Northeast Ridge and follow it to the top, or it might be more in keeping with the rest of the route to doggedly stay on the very crest of the ridge/arete to the summit.

Most parties prefer two #4s though I have led it safely with one #3.   The first pitch starts down on the Tombstone ledge and is a 5.7 serrated crack that has a short flaring 5.8 crux up high. Careful on the crux, it comes just above an ankle crushing ledge.  The second pitches O.W. is rewarded by one of the best hand cracks at the Leap.   The third pitch climbs a rapidly steepening face to a fixed pin and then rounds a very windy and exposed arete, across an exposed ledge and up to two fixed pins that can be backed up with a .75" piece.   The rest of the route is a classic 4th-class to easy-5th-class dike hike that climbs up the face to the top. Not much harder than climbing a ladder.

Then you top out, and realize that the main wall of Lover's Leap hovers over you, and that you're a mere peon in between the giant walls of horizontal dykes.   For a 5.7, this has an excellent variety of terrian for only 3 pitches.   Accessing the route is easy: Walking up to the Lower Buttress,  walk right until you find the first set of bolts. Then walk a little more to the second set of bolts, which is Pillar of Society (.12a). The next crack is the Direct Start of Surrealistic Pillar (.10a), and finally you'll be on a tier with a flat face and a couple of large horns about 15 - 20 feet off the ground. You're here.  Pitch 1:  Climb up to the horns, and continue up and left to a well protected crack system to a wide (4") left facing crack.  Pitch 2:  Follow this crack up for about 4 dykes, where you need to cross to a large horn. Follow this around the arete, where you can belay from a ledge.   Pitch 3: Simple. Go up the face with large jugs and belay from something suitable up top.

parent_url: /v/mount-rainier/105877031 
route_description: A classic route on the Northwest side of Mount Rainier. The route itself ascends more of what I would describe as a terraced buttress and ledges than an actual ridge, regardless, Ptarmigan Ridge offers fantastic position and interesting and often varied climbing. Consider the enjoyable approach to a scenic highcamp that you often have all to yourself and it makes Ptarmigan a worthwhile objective for any experienced and fit climber. The route consists of snow climbing(40-55 degrees) and often several sections of mixed rock/snow/ice. The route is steeper and more sustained than it's classic neighbor Liberty Ridge and requires almost 1000 feet greater elevation gain on summit day due to a start at 9,800ft on Mowich Glacier versus Liberty Ridge's 10,700ft start from Thumb Rock.   From 10K highcamp downclimb loose rock or steep snow a few hundred feet onto the Mowich Glacier. Crossing the Bergschrund is typically accomplished by finding a bridge just left of a rock outcropping about center of the face but an end-run may be necessary if the schrund cannot be passed in this area. You can easily view the condition of the shcrund from highcamp on the ridge. Once above the schrund climb 40-45 degree snow for about 1000ft until just below large rock cliffs where you make a traverse left into an hourglass shaped snow face below the large rock buttress that splits the upper route. Climb 45-55 degree snow to base of rock buttress at 11,500ft. There are two possible variations to the route that ascend from this point at the base of the buttress. (1) The original ascent traverses left onto exposed snow slopes then contours around  and up onto Liberty Cap and climbs between the rock buttress on right and the icefall on left(45-55 degrees, often icy) it then ascends towards summit as described below.  (2) The 1966 variation traverses right and up from the base of the rock buttress. Depending on conditions this section may be good styrofoam snow or verglassed rock or water ice or a combination of all. After several hundred feet of climbing you will move out onto the very left margin of the Mowich Face. Continue a rising traverse to the second rock gully encountered. One or two pins may be present in this short vertical rock step. Easier scrambling above this  leads to the Liberty Cap Glacier. From here follow moderate terrain to Liberty Cap where one must descend a few hundred feet then climb back up several hundred feet to reach the 14,410ft summit of Columbia Crest. Recommend descent via Emmons Glacier route. Once on route few bivy sites exist until you exit the rock gully onto the lower Liberty Cap Glacier. There are excellent bivy sites higher near Liberty Cap and Columbia Crest. Although the route can and sometimes is completed from highcamp along with the descent to White River without a bivy it makes for a very long day. A summit bivy adds a great finish to the days climbing and allows for a rested descent the next morning down the Emmons and the exit hike to White River.

route_description: Approach via the White River Campground/Glacier Basin Trail and hike into the base of the ridge on the Carbon Glacier via St. Elmos Pass and across Curtis Ridge (most parties camp on Curtis Ridge). After negotiating the cracks on the Carbon Glacier, start scouting your access onto the ridge (either side can be accessed around 8000 ft). Climb 30-40 degree snow slopes and traverse scree and rocks up to Thumb Rock at 10,500 ft. From Thumb Rock, either go straight up a short ice pitch (70-80 degrees) in the center of a rock band, or traverse up and left/right around the cliff. From 11,000 to 12,000, stay on or near the crest of the ridge and climb increasingly steeper slopes and maybe a few icy sections up to 50 degrees. At 12k (Black Pyramid) go east (left) out onto the Willis Wall on exposed snow/ice faces up to 60 degrees. Climb several pitches of 50-60 degree ice and negotiate steep glacier travel until gaining the Liberty Cap Glacier around 13,500 ft. Seasonal bridges and icy ledges provide passage up onto the glacier - be prepared to climb a few short (5-8 ft) vertical ice sections to surpass the bergschrund and other cracks. Once through, the slope angle decreases until the Liberty Cap summit is reached at 14,112 ft. Either head down from here or go across the broad plateau to a col (13,600 ft) and then on to Columbia Crest at 14,411 ft. Many parties descend the well-traveled Emmons-Winthrop route down to Camp Shurman.

The route is sustained and committing and a real challenge for a 5.8 leader.   P1 - There are 2 potential starts, but the right side is cleaner and more aesthetic. The first pitch is 165' and ascends a series of hand cracks, fist cracks, and off-width cracks. Belay at the stump or continue left and up to the rap station.  P2 - Work your way up using your off-width and chimney skills to a belay about 120' up. Be sure to move left at the ramp!  P3 - Some more awkward climbing leads to a shelf about 110' up on a ledge.

While the route weaves its way up an impressive band of rock at a relatively easy grade, there are certainly other moderate climbs of superior aesthetic quality.  Perhaps it is the history behind the climb, first negotiated in 1936, or the easy approach combined with an accessible grade of 5.7 A0, or the simple fact that it serves as the most effective approach to North Dome that makes the climb so popular... I don't know... but don't expect to be alone on this route.    Approach Royal Arches from the Ahwahnee parking lot.  The most heavily traveled trail, well right of Serenity Crack, is likely to be the correct trail.  The start of the climb is in a chimney in the back of a huge left-facing corner.  The highlights: Climb up the chimney past a chockstone (5.6).  Make a long 3rd class traverse on ledges to the right.  Climb a steep, polished ramp/groove (5.5).  Once again, traverse right on 3rd and 4th class ground -- do not be tempted to start climbing up the face or corners, continue right as far as possible.  Eventually head up on a 5.7 finger crack.  At this point, follow the chalk and clean rock up various crack and ledge systems for several pitches, eventually ending up in a left-facing corner system.  At the top of this corner system there is a bolted anchor on the face from which a 30' length of fixed line is attached.  Clip this for pro, and either pendulum left or climb left (two moves of polished 5.10-) to a ledge system.  Follow this way to the left.  Climb up either side of a giant hollow flake, then step left to some tree climbing to a belay alcove.  Step around a corner to the left and continue up on low angle 5.6-5.7 terrain.  Just below the headwall and roof systems, continue traversing left following the line of least resistance.  One pitch climbs through some dirt mounds.  Shortly after there is another traversing pitch with a two bolt anchor -- make note of this if you plan to rappel.  One more traversing pitch finishes the climb -- this one can feel a bit sketchy compared to the rest of the climb.  Traverse high for gear in a dirty undercling, or traverse low to clip a lone bolt.  Either way beware of pine needles on the slab.  This pitch is strange in that it seamlessly merges into an actual trail into the woods... kinda cool.  Other miscellaneous notes:    Topping out involves following the trail left and then up.Right where the climb ends there is a great spring with water that is safe to drink -- you can't miss it.Sleep in!  There are numerous places on the climb to pass or be passed.The rappel route is fast and effective and can be done with one or two ropes.  I highly recommend consulting with the SuperTopo guide for specific details on the locations of the rap stations.The walkoff is via the North Dome Gully.  For parties only doing Royal Arches (and not doing another climb on North Dome), the raps are the way to go.  For parties continuing on to North Dome (or for climbs on the Washington Column), the Gully would be much faster.

parent_url: /v/crescent-crack-buttress/105739365 
route_description: Hand Jive is generally approached by climbing Crack in the Woods first, or you can climb the chimney leading up to the crack.  It is the appealing-looking thin hands crack above and right of Crack in the Woods.    From Crack in the Woods, downclimb into the chimney and undercling out right into the crack system.  Liebacking and jamming leads to a bolted rap anchor, which will just barely get you to the ground with one 60m rope.  This pitch felt harder and more insecure to me than Crack in the Woods.  I'd give this 8+ or 9-.

To the left of the chimneys is a 60' finger and thin hand crack - this is it.    Climb a few feet up an easy chimney, and then climb the steep but bomber thin hands crack over a small bulge.  Mostly 5.8 with a couple of harder moves.  There are chains at the top, or better yet continue up Hand Jive.

parent_name: The Bastille - N Face 
parent_url: /v/the-bastille---n-face/105744723 
route_description: One of the most classic climbs in the country, it begins right off the road on the Bastille, a 350' cliff on the left as you enter the canyon. Often crowded, a weekday is probably the best time to attempt this climb.    The climb is north facing and in the shade until mid-afternoon.  As Jim Erickson said in his classic 1980 Rocky Heights guidebook, "avoid it like the plague if the weather is not warm, or you will shiver away much of its charm."  Start at the center of the north face of the Bastille, below a hand crack that starts 20' up the wall, with a huge, serrated flake to its right.  The first pitch has been the site of numerous accidents, so make sure you're solid on 5.7 crack climbing and placing pro before attempting to lead it.  P1. 5.7, 60'.  Climb up to the flake and step left to the crack. Jam or layback up the polished crack (crux), then follow the crack up and left to a small stance at a 2-bolt anchor with chains.  You can belay here (if you want to watch/coach your second through the crux), or continue with the second pitch.  P2. 5.6, 90'.  Climb up to the chimney left of the bolts, and step left onto the face.  Climb up to a finger crack, then traverse right above a little roof (crux). Continue up steep, enjoyable cracks and angle up left on easy ground to a sloping ledge by a steep wall.  Belay at a crack with a fixed pin.  If this belay is occupied, it's possible to belay about 20' lower at another stance.  Variation: near the top of P2, take a right-angling wide crack up and back left, 5.8.  Bring a big cam (#4 Camalot) to protect this line.  P1 & P2 can be combined with a 50m rope.  P3. 5.7, 50'. Climb up into a pod, then work up past a small roof (crux).  Continue up the cracks to another sloping ledge.  A #1 and #2 Camalot are useful for the belay anchor.  P4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin.  Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux).  Go all the way left to a hand crack and climb it to a corner.  Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation.  Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney.  P5.  Several options here:  a. Easy finish: 5.4, 60'.  Climb the chimney to the top.  b. Fun finish: 5.8, 80'. Climb up a ramp right of the chimney to a huge corner with a wide crack. Climb up the face left of the corner to a fixed pin. Continue up the steep headwall and surmount a little roof at the top (crux). If you have a #3 and #4 Camalot, you can belay just above the roof (and watch/coach your second at the crux roof), otherwise continue up an easy gully and belay from a spike of rock at the top.  c. Grovel finish: 5.7, 80'.  Climb the wide crack in the corner just right of the previous variation.  To descend: follow deep grooves to the south until you reach a dirt trail. Go 30' right (west) and  then follow the marked Bastille descent trail north and down to the road at the base of the cliff.   (Ed. Note: beginner leaders--make sure you're solid on crack techique before trying this one. Placing gear is not trivial for the inexperienced.)

route_description: This route climbs the entire 1000+ feet of the First Flatiron, and is pure joy the whole way up.  The pitches are based upon using a 50m rope.  It's 7 for a 60m rope.  P1:  Start at the base of the Flatiron, just across and left of the bridge. Follow a water gully up, passing two eye bolts on the left side, to belay on a ledge by the tree if you have a 60meter rope. Otherwise, you'll have to belay at a small shelf about 1/2 way there.  P2:  Continue straight up, belaying at another nice ledge a rope length up.  P3:  Scramble up easier terrain to a belay. (Yes it's vague. Just go a rope length, and find a good ledge).  P4:  Scamble again straight up and a little left. Belay on a ledge that could hold 20 people, on top of the headwall.  P5:  Head left and up, towards a slot at the left end of the roof.  P6:  Follow up the slot and start on the ridge traverse.     P7-10: It's 2-4 pitches from here to the actual summit block.

parent_name: Durrance Approach 
parent_url: /v/durrance-approach/105714408 
route_description: The Durrance route is listed as one of the 50 classic climbs in North America. A 4-6 pitch route that tops out at the summit. The climb is mainly off-width and hand-crack with a few spots of chimney. You also get the choice of working a small traverse. Don't forget to register at the Visitor's Center before and after the climb. This is a crowded route and a few minutes can mean the difference between success and failure. Either plan to arrive around 5:30 AM or, if your fast and have headlamps, try to start in the late afternoon.   Note: All directional references in this description are accurate if you are facing the rock.   Approach: You have two choices here. To walk to the base of the 1st pitch... hike up the trail from the Visitor's Center and head to the right at the Tower trail. Almost immediately head left on a faint trail that angles up toward the base of the tower. Continue up an easy ramp to the base of the leaning column and the start of the Durrance. To climb up to the base of the 1st pitch... Continue hiking on the concrete Tower trail to the South side of the tower. You will come to a clear path just past the leaning column as you look up. Take this path past the registration reminder sign for 5 minutes to the base of the tower and the 1st pitch of Wiessner's route. Climb this 5.4 crack to a couple of bolts about 100 feet off of the deck. Traverse left (if facing the wall) on easy 4th class to the base of the leaning column.   Pitch 1, Leaning Column (70 feet): Ascend 20 feet up a low angle crack that quickly turns vertical. Continue up another 25 feet of off-width to a horizontal crack with a piton. Enter the chimney behind the pillar and ascend another 25feet and exit onto the top of the column to a nice belay ledge with bolts.  Pitch 2, Durrance Crack (70 feet): A two crack system heads straight up for about 70 feet. The left crack is hand-width and accepts good pro for about 50 feet. The right crack is off-width and contains a large chockstone. Good pro can be found in the left hand crack until you get to the chockstone at about 55 feet. From the chockstone, depending on how tall you are, you must commit to the right crack and face the crux of the pitch. Save your #4 Camalot or equivalent to protect the crux. If you do not have anything this size, you will probably be climbing the last 15 or so feet of this crack high above your last piece. Exit to your right onto the belay ledge with bolts. 1 Piton available about 15 feet up.  Pitch 3, Cussin' Crack (30 feet): Climb a face and off-width combo to a small ledge 20 feet up. Protect this with a number #4 or #5 stopper or equivalent on the flake to the left of the crack. From the small ledge traverse right on a 1-foot ramp to an easy and well-protected hand crack. You also have the option of continuing straight up from the small ledge in an off-width... but the right side crack is far easier. Exit onto a nice belay ledge with bolts. Be sure to run some slings from your pro to reduce rope drag if you go to the right side crack.   Pitch 4, Flake Crack (40 feet):  Ascend obvious crack system on right side of huge belay ledge. A number of flakes protruding from the crack (hence the name) and some face holds for the feet will make this quite enjoyable after the off-widths lower on the route. Exit via off-width (go figure) with bomber hands onto yet another great belay ledge with bolts. Watch for some loose rock on this pitch. 1 piton is available about 15 feet up.  Pitch 5, Chockstone Crack (40 feet): Head up into a large off-width or chimney, depending on how big you are. The first 20 feet are fairly basic. The top half of this pitch is a little harder and finishes with an overhanging boulder that you must clear to exit. It will get the blood flowing, but has some decent hands to keep it relatively tame. Exit to a large belay ledge. For the first time on the route... you may be able to find some shade in a large crack on your left. Belay your second from the bolts and prepare for the jump traverse. Note: you can look down and right to spot the bolts for the second rap that you may use for your descent, they are a little harder to spot when rappelling, as they will be below you after your first rap from the summit.   Pitch 6, Jump Traverse (15 foot traverse): From the belay ledge on top of Chockstone crack, down-climb 5 feet to a small ledge. Traverse under a small roof to a horizontal finger crack. Traverse finger crack and reach back for the ledge that marks the _landing zone_ for the _jump_. Very few, if any, people actually jump on this pitch and it is not recommended. Most use the piton just around the roof to hold onto and keep the rating 5.6. If you eschew the piton, you earn a 5.8 rating for this move and the climb. Continue through a small tunnel (a nice shady spot to rest if you need it) right of the jump traverse and across the meadows to the far right crack system and climb 100 or so feet to the top. Some rope up for this section and some parties don't. Enjoy the summit.  Pitch 6 Variation, Bailey's Direct (150 feet): From top of Chockstone crack ascend up 5.4 crack that goes back and forth between hands and off-width. Exit onto summit. This finish avoids the jump traverse and has the aesthetic appeal of climbing directly to the summit.  Rappel: From the summit head back towards the top of Bailey's direct and down-climb a few feet to a rappel station. Your first rap will put you back in the meadows near the jump traverse. Down-climb to your right to some bolts below and right of the jump traverse. Make three more raps down the Bowling Alley a few hundred feet right of the Durrance route and just right of Wiessner to the base and go get some water. All raps require 2 ropes. Be careful to always rap over the nose of each pillar and NOT in the crack or else your rope will be eaten and get stuck.  Be prepared to answer all manner of questions from tourists as you race for the water fountain.   Bring lots of water and conserve it.   A truly classic climb.

route_description: See approach for TAD and Solar.  This route starts to the right of TAD, and is in my opinion by far the best route of the three mentioned.  Pitch one is a good lead of about 5.7 and is well suited for those getting into trad climbing on the Tower.  Pitch two is longer and is very sustained 5.8 climbing.  Both pitches swollow up gear and you can protect pitch 2 with as many hand-fist sized hexes and cams as you can carry.  The crux will prove to be the small bulge 2/3 up on pitch 2 and the slightly narrowing crack as it tapers toward the top of the route where it ends at the Meadows.  NOTE: This route can be rappelled with two ropes in two pitches, but it's recommended that you rappell in three pitches, the third being at the anchors at the ledge about 25-30 feet up from the start of the route.  Rappelling in two will increase the likelyhood of having your ropes hung up on the aformentioned ledge when it is pulled.

route_description: Soler is a wonderful two pitch route climbing twin fingercracks in a dihedral.  It is probably the easiest summit route on the tower that isn't wider than hands, and may feel easier than the 7s and 8s to those who don't know how to jam.  Follow the ramp around a prominent corner.  Soler starts in a dihedral right of a bolted route and two cracks left of TAD.  Climb a long sustained pitch past some slightly broken rock at the very bottom to a hanging belay at a couple of bolts.  Pitch 2 is more of the same to a large ledge at the base of the Meadows.    Pitch 1 is generally given 5.8 and 2 is 5.9-, but I can't tell them apart.  Probably rated that way because you are already a little pumped when starting pitch 2.

route_description: [Start] about 20' left of the start of Five and Dime at an obvious right facing corner with a crack system on the left face and another in the back of the corner. Serves as the standard warm up pitch. Great pro, mainly in the tight hands size, but will take from fingers to fist at different points. At the top, I've always went into the chimney rather than stay in the crack on the left face. Crux is about halfway up, transitioning between the crack systems with cool stemming. The chimney section will pro with hand or fist sized pieces, but is short, secure and easy.

Once you clip the 5th bolt you have to turn to your left and come over a small bulge to get the 6th bolt.  I felt that after the second bolt the climbing was pretty consistent difficulty wise and the climb was just pure fun.  I did not expect to find such a well bolted fun moderate sport route in the valley, kudos to the FA party on this gem.

At nearly a full (old-school) ropelength, it provides a through introduction to the kind of grunty, meat-and-potatoes climbing that is so frequently encountered in the Valley.  As such, it is worth seeking out on its own, although a nondescript second pitch links it into Super Slide.  This would turn the latter from a casual romp into more of a half-day affair.  Most people will expend more calories getting up the deceptively low-angle groove of Trial By Fire than on the alleged 5.9 business of Super Slide.  Strong likelihood of seasonal wetness.

Supertopo lists the route as 5 pitches, but it is very easy and recommended to link pitches 1 and 2 into a single 150' pitch.    Start at an ant-infested tree and climb dirty corner past a small pine tree.  Continue up to an oak tree (long sling helps reduce rope drag), and start traversing right along broken ledge system, passing one ancient 1/4" bolt about half-way along the ledge.  Belay below a nice-looking, clean hand crack.    Pitch 2 ascends the clean 5.8 crack above, with a cruxy step left at about 90' up.  Belay at 135' at a good stance and one solid bolt.    Pitch 3 tackles a 5.9+ crack with perfect finger locks.  When the crack suddenly ends (surprise!), make a delicate couple of steps left (5.10a) and continue up easier ground (5.7) to the top (115').  As for all the routes at the Five Open Books area, be exceedingly careful not to dislodge loose rocks from the top.  To descend, walk to climber's left for several hundred yards along good (but sometimes exposed) trail.

route_description: This is one of the classic crack boulder problems in the Valley. Approximately 20' tall with a short approach, flat landing, and easy walk off,  this slightly leaning splitter finger crack is great for honing your thin fingercrack technique. Mostly first knuckle locks. Usually bouldered, but you could rig a TR if desired.  "Climb the beautiful splitter finger crack that angles up and left.  First 5 feet are the hardest by far." - ShaunG

route_description: An easy start leads to a wild and improbable second pitch.  This climb is located immediately left of the Grack Center route.  The best start is  on the very large platform left of the Grack gully/dihedral, because a 60 meter rope won't reach the P1 belay from the bottom of the Grack gully/dihedral (unless you simul-climb 25 feet).  P1 - Shares much of the same crack as the Grack Center.  Head up a gentle left facing dihedral to the bushy eucalyptus tree with slings & rappel rings.  Traverse one move right into a crack about 50 feet before the tree (5.6), or head directly to the tree and straight up a jagged hand crack (5.5).  190 feet.  P2  Gently climb through the eucalyptus tree and up a steep/slightly overhanging left facing dihedral (5.7).  A final tricky mantel move, which will definitely get your attention, gets you out of the dihedral and onto 4th class terrain.  Head up and right to a large block with runners for the belay.  140 feet.

Although the route is bolted, it is not really a "sport" climb, as there are only 4 protection bolts in 65 feet.  A fall before clipping the second bolt would likely result in a ground fall.  As such, I have given it a "PG-13" rating.  If you are not up for leading the route, it is possible to scramble up the gully to the left with a section of 4th class terrain, do one single rope rap down to the anchors.  One more rap gets you to the ground.

route_description: This is a nice ridge with a ton of 3rd/4th class climbing and a few short 5th class sections mixed in.  Follow the ridge towards Peak 13,151 staying on the ridge as it tries to spit you off to the left (South).  Climb fun 3rd and 4th class and walk the cool knife edge ridge as pictured in Crofts guide.  As you near Peak 13,151 you are forced off the ridge to the South and must make a few 5th class moves and meander back and forth to reach the summit of Peak 13,151.  From here you descend the ridge and encounter a short steep notch  10 5.7 downclimb or rappel.  Continue down the ridge and up the next sub-peak and on the other side another 10 5.6 downclimb or rappel.  You are now at the main notch where many people begin the climb via hiking up the scree gully to the South.    Gain the ridge again as soon as you can via a 4th class trough.  Continue on the 3rd/4th class ridge to a headwall.  Go around the corner to the left and up 5.2 cracks.  3rd class leads to easier ground and eventually a flat plateau.  Turn right (North) towards the summit staying low to the left of the ridge to reach a notch  Married Mens Point.  Pick out the easiest line and climb 100 or so of low 5th class and then 3rd class to the summit.   Descent:  Downclimb the route rappelling where necessary.  From the notch take the scree gullies to the South and then head East over talus.  In early season the scree gullies can be full of snow which cant be seen from the approach.

route_description: This pitch is a fun and somewhat physical option for those who reach the top of Reed's Direct p2 and still want more - but not quite as much as Reed's 3rd pitch offers.    Fire up steep double cracks at the back of a shallow 'chimney' to pull onto a sloping ledge.  These cracks will alternately take knees, fists, armbars, and handstacks - the shallow chimney provides infinite no hands rests with the right body language.  Before you turn right onto the sloping ledge, gaze at the continuation of the left crack: a hard looking and overhung offwidth.      From the sloping ledge follow the nice crack as it curves up to a roof, which is easily pulled on the featured granite that abounds here.  A great pitch if you're looking for relatively tame, well protected, and non-sustained semi-wide climbing.

route_description: I always thought this was a fairly enjoyable route. Mike's Books is found on the south side of I-Rock. The first pitch (the first "book") is formed by a big rounded chunk of rock that makes a right-facing corner/ramp. I haven't been over there in recent years, but it seemed pretty popular a while back.  P1: There are two potential starts to the route:    1) Directly below the corner, there is a steep chute that goes at 5.8. I recall there was some protection, but it requires care when exiting the chute to climb up to the main corner.   2) You can go out left of the 5.8 start and climb up onto a sloping ledge. This ledge can then be traversed back right to reach the base of the first "book". Once you reach the right-facing corner, climb up this (pretty moderate) to reach a bolted belay anchor [replaced 1/02 with 1/2" stainless and camouflaged hangers - ed.].   P2: From the bolted anchor, move left into another right-facing corner system (the second "book"). Climb this until it ends, and continue to the top via slab. There is another bolted anchor on top [replaced 1/02 with 1/2" stainless and camouflaged hangers - ed.].  Descent: You can either rap the route in two half-rope rappels (fairly quick and if your packs are at the base...), or you can cross over to the top of the North Overhang route and do a half-rope rap to a large ledge on the north side (where the Upper Right Ski Track starts) and scramble down from there.

route_description: On the southern end of the west face, just left of the Southwest Passage Route there is a groove/corner that climbs up and left to a sloping ledge, then up and out through the right hand edge of a large bulge. Getting out of the initial groove and onto the sloping ledge is the first crux (5.7 with grainy rock and tricky protection if not careful). You can belay there if desired... then the real crux is getting out past the right hand edge of the bulge above and onto the easy, but runout slab above that.This was considerably harder than the book-assigned grade unless you cheat well to the left, going close to the Bat Crack (5.5) and traversing back right and in. It felt at least 5.8... or maybe harder.  Belay from above, then rap twice first down to the sloping ledge, and then to the ground.

parent_url: /v/crescent-crack-buttress/105739365 
route_description: This is a pretty great route on the verge of being two stars due to a kind of lame traverse on the last pitch.  However this can easily be remedied by the Crescent Crack Direct Variation plus or minus Final Link (although this increases the grade to 5.9).  Overall I still give the climb three stars as the rock and moves are just so good for a relatively easy climb and it puts you in a great position to finish the climb in a much better style.  When you hit the buttress from the trail hike left until you come to a well worn dirt "platform" below an angling groove gully.  Pitch one:Climb left up the chimney in the gully through to some trees.  There are some great easy crack moves here, very well protected.  Probably 5.6 climbing.  If you only have a 50 meter rope you may need to belay at the trees as I am not sure if it will reach the chain anchor above. (This would cause the climb to be three pitches.) A 60 meter rope will reach, so continue up past the trees to the belay anchor.  There is a move of 5.7 perhaps as you pull a bulge reaching the anchor.  Pitch two:Climb the crux offwidth above the chains (5.7), kind of hard to protect.  I don't want to give the answer away, but there is an easy way to climb this and a hard way.  See what happens.  This only lasts 10 feet or so and then you are on an angling crack moving up and right.  You will come to a point where you will have the opportunity to traverse down a sloping slab to the right. BE SURE to protect the second here as you traverse down.  Belay at the big ledge.  Descent:Scramble up right and then down the gully.  It is a walk off.    FYI: To put this climb in perspective, the first time my partner and I roped up to climb this classic we were joined by a guy who was soloing the route at the same time.  I think he lapped me about 5 times while I methodically climbed the 2/3 pitches.  It was impressive, and I am sure he was doing laps before we even got there.

route_description: The direct variation to Crescent Crack is a good way to finish  the topout of Crescent Crack, or as an approach to the bolted slab, the Final Link (5.9).  Instead of traversing down and right at the sloping shelf on top of pitch two, continue up the dihedral (thin, 5.9).  Pass a piton on the left, then work up through an awkward section to a ledge.  From here, Final Link works left with a hard mantle and a bolt, or finish by heading right and up.

Clip next bolt then set up belay at the two bolts.  Beautiful slab that wanders a bit left and right.  runners could be helpful on a few of the bolts to reduce rope drag.  If done as the finish to Crescent Crack this route has it all.

After that, the gear is great until the anchors.  Clip the manky pin left of the crack, then traverse into the crack.  Place a small cam, then climb up the beautiful finger crack for 80' to the large roof.  From here two options exist.  Traverse right (easier) to the anchors, or traverse left to anchors.  Going left is highly recommended and adds some more fun climbing to the pitch.    Descent) Rap with one rope back to the base.

The first pitch ends at a set of chain anchors and a small foot ledge.  Many people rap at this point (one rope), but the second pitch is also pretty good.  P2)  5.7 Continue up the crack through the trees, angling right until a crack starts going straight up.  Climb this (low angle) to a thin traverse at a chicken head.  Continue easily to the right with a tree with anchors.  Descent) Downclimb 10 - 15 feet to a set of chain anchors on the face.  Rap 100' down to the deck.

route_description: Snake Dike (along with Royal Arches) is one of the classic long moderate routes of Yosemite. For many climbers, this is number one on the Yosemite tick list when they first come to the Valley. For others it is known as "Snake Hike," but the bottom line is it is a great climb up an amazing natural feature to the top of one of the most spectacular formations in Yosemite - second only to El Cap itself.  Get to the SW shoulder of Half Dome by following the Muir Trail to the Mist Trail past Nevada Falls, then back on the Muir Trail.  From the top of Nevada Falls, continue for 0.75 mile to an obvious climber's trail that heads off to the left, contouring around behind the back of Liberty Cap to Half Dome.  You'll pass a swampy area (Lost Lake), and then wander up slabs to the south face of Half Dome, heading back left across ledges to the base of the route.  The approach is six miles and takes 2.5 to 4 hours.  P1: The route starts up a slab below a prominent upside-down L-shaped roof formation.  A big tree is up in this roof area on the right.  Climb up into the roof, then traverse out the left end and up onto a nice belay ledge.  5.7.  P2:  Continue up the left-facing corner system above and past a pair of bolts (optional belay), then wander right past another bolt to a bolted anchor.  5.7.  P3:  Climb up and left past a bolt and 5.7 friction to reach the dike itself.  Skip another bolted belay, climbing up the dike past a bolt and easier climbing, and up to a bolted belay.  P4, P5, P6:  Follow the dike for three more long pitches, all about 5.4, all very run out, stopping at bolted anchors.  The final anchor is at a point past a steep section on a small ledge.  P7, P8: Lots of low angle climbing (easy 5th class) wander up the face with occasional gear placements.  Once you feel comfortable unroping, do so, and continue scrambling up 1000' of calf-burning slabs to the summit.  Descent is down the Half Dome Cables route.  You can't miss it.  For logistical reasons, it's better to not leave anything at the base.

route_description: Amazing alpine ice route with a relatively short approach.  Generally steep snow and 50-55 degree ice for 6 continuous pitches.  Generally stay on the right side of the couloir (though both sides can be climbed) because the slope of the chute funnels rock and ice to the left side.  I have seen this climb in various conditions from steep neve mixed with ice to bullet-proof steep blue ice from top to bottom.  I have never seen it as a snow couloir as is shown in S.P. Parker's guidebook.  The North Couloir is the farthest right couloir on the north face.  It should be obvious because it is the largest chute.  When you arrive at the top of the ice at the notch, either ascend low 5th class rock to the summit (climbers right from the notch) or descend south and down to Conness Lake.

Start up a 3rd class ramp and belay at a thick shrub / small tree (whatever you want to call it).  There is a good bolt that protects the face friction to gain the corner / lieback about 15' from the belay shrub.  Then follow the lieback up to some broken ledges until you reach another belay shrub.  Avoid the steep crack that looks harder than 5.6 (5.9) or charge up it with good pro.  P2: 5.6 or less. Continue up the broken ledges and up a short crack that accepts wider pro.  Finish near the lip with a gear anchor wherever is convenient.  Walk off right to gain the upper sloping section of Lembert, then follow it down the backside on the easiest path pack to the parking lot.  No real downclimbing required and pretty easy (unless wet).

We headed up the left side and stayed closer to the edge of the arête. It looks like there is a second chimney to the right. In either case this ends below a huge section of white quartz, hence the name Crystal Crag.. A short half pitch of this put us on the ridge. A couple hundred feet of mixed third and fourth class climbing with the occasional fifth class move thrown in the summit.

Many people start up and to the right a little, which loses some vertical, and the first pitch over there isn't so good.  However you start, after 3 pitches, steadily increasing from 5.3 to 5.6, you'll probably be funneled into a chimney.  It can get crowded here, and a backpack can be a real pain.  Climb around to the left and it's smooth sailing however.  There are so many options, passing people is generally easy if you're competent at the grade, and there are usually people all over the face.  A spectacular climb not to be missed.

Low down there really is not one best way to go. Just up.  From a large ledge halfway up the face, the ridge starts to lead the the west side.  Most will simul-climb or solo the bottom 3/4. Up high you can make it easy or hard.  We stayed on the right side of the ridge and belayed on great ledges (kept some pitches short because this route has some loose rock). I think that you can find a 5.8 pitch out left just before the summit, but this looked loose.

From the tree the second pitch contains some 5.5 moves, but due to the low angle of the rock it doesn't feel that way.  A 60 m rope gets you from the tree to the end of the second pitch.  Use a 50 m and you will be belaying from the crack itself.  Not that this is a bad thing as it helps to build confidence in belaying without a ledge.  The third pitch is again very easy to climb and protect.  Upon reaching the top, walk off to the left to return to more climbs or to head for climbs at the Leap.

parent_name: Thunderbolt Peak 
parent_url: /v/thunderbolt-peak/105914886 
route_description: Another posting of the Thunderbolt to Sill Traverse (but misnamed the Palisade Traverse) is posted ?here?.  This super classic route takes you on a tour of five 14,000ft summits.  Start by climbing Thunderbolt Peak.  Many options exist; we climbed Southwest Chute #1, which went at 4th class.  This deposits you at the base of the summit block.  Gaining the top of the summit block involves a few exposed moves of 5.9, and is the crux of the entire route.  There are ample places to build an anchor for your belayer, but there is no pro until you get to the top (only about 15 feet). A fall would either be factor 2, or (more likely) you would land you in a pile of boulders before the rope came taught.  Either way it wouldn't be good.  Belay from bolts on top.  From Thunderbolt, downclimb and then follow the ridge to a small tower.  Pass the tower by downclimbing to the left, cutting right eventually to gain some slabs (some exposed class 4), and then climb up to the summit of Starlight.  The summit block of Starlight was the only other place where we belayed (although many may feel a belay is justified at other places along the traverse).  The summit block is called the "Milk Bottle" for obvious reasons, and goes at 5.4.  Great photo opportunity here.  From Starlight, some more exposed downclimbing leads to a small gap in the ridge.  We rappelled into the gap and then pendulumed across to the ledge on the other side.  After this follow exposed ledges out right, which supposedly lead to a class 4 climb to the summit of North Palisade.  We didn't find the class 4 route, and ended up on terrain that felt 5.5 or 5.6 and very exposed.  From North Palisade a short scramble leads to the top of the chimney above the U-Notch.  One double rope, or two single rope rappels lead to the top of the U-Notch.  Cross the U-Notch, and once again follow exposed ledges (class 4) out right, and then some exciting class 4 straight up to the summit of Polemonium.    From Polemonium, a class 4 downclimb leads to the boulder field on the back side of Sill.  Follow the boulders to a notch in the ridge a couple hundred feet below Sill's summit.  Drop your packs here and scramble up to tag Sill's summit. Don't forget to admire the view while you're there, it's quite impressive.   Head back to your packs, and head down the last class 4 downclimb of the day.  At the bottom of the downclimb, head right on ledges to Apex Notch.  From the notch head down the L-shaped Couloir to the Palisade Glacier, then through Galey camp to the Sam Mack Meadow Trail.  It's all trail and mostly downhill from here all the way back to Glacier Lodge.  Finally, at Glacier Lodge exchange high fives and have yourself a victory beer, you just summited one-third of California's fourteeners in a day!  A couple of thoughts: -We shuttled by dropping a car at glacier lodge and then driving to South Lake to start the hike.    -After reaching the summit block of Thunderbolt it took us 9 hours to reach the summit of Sill. Granted we had 6 people so belaying at the two technical summit blocks, and the rappels, took awhile.  I'm sure this can be climbed much faster by a competent party of two.  -The last for-sure place to fill up water is at a lake just after Bishop Pass.  The next place to get water was Sam Mack Meadow, which we reached about 14 hours later.  So bring plenty of containers to fill up at Bishop Pass!  -Locating the trail from Gayley camp to Sam Mack Meadow can be tricky, especially in the dark.  Make every effort to be on the good trail before sundown.

parent_url: /v/north-palisade/105804277 
route_description: A nice alpine route which is almost out of character for the High Sierra. Save time wherever possible. Also get an alpine start.  From Sam Mack Meadow climb the lefthand gully at the back of the meadow, bear right under the Palisade Glacier moraine, through another shallow gully just to its right (Thunderbolt Peak framed in the notch) and so gradually gain the crest of the moraine. Follow it until it peters out (wonderful views of North Pal) then head straight up to the start of the couloir. About 1 hour from Sam Mack Meadow.  Part 1 The Couloir  In early season it's soft or hard snow by late season it's blue ice.  The first obstacle is crossing the bergschrund, which can be easy in early season and seriously hard in late season. Once established above the couloir suck it up and start climbing. Keep to the right, sometimes a break can be taken in a moat which may be there, there are slings also, for late season ascents. Keep going until reaching a tongue of rock dividing the couloir, skirt left around this and head up into The Notch.  Part 2 The Open Chimney 5.6  To the right lies a steep step which is negotiated using a groove which turns into a chimney in 2 pitches. Towards the top of the 2nd pitch bear right, to exit The Notch just by the summit snowfield.  Part 3 The Ridge  Best soloed or simul-climbed. Cross rocks above the summit snowfield, then, before the First Pinnacle, cross over onto the south side of the ridge and scramble along to eventually reach a well-earned summit.

route_description: You haven't really climbed it unless you've gotten inside the chimney and done the "belly roll"!   P1: Climb the wide crack until it leans leftward and opens into a squeeze chimney. Dive in there and worm your way upward (your belayer will die laughing; make sure they don't have a camera) to easier ground. Continue up past a corner, and belay on the ledge. (5.4, 70ft.)  P2: Go up the short, right-facing corner, then up past a crack to the top. (5.2, 50ft.)  Descend via the Uberfall Descent - much quicker and less tangled than rapping.

route_description: High Exposure.  The climbing itself is flawless, but when one considers that the FA was done by pioneers Hans Kraus and Fritz Wiessner in 1941, it's even more incredible!  The name, of course, is completely appropriate for this must-do Gunks mega-classic.  The High E buttress is an obvious right-facing arete that is visible from the drive in from New Paltz.  It is located about halfway along the base of the Trapps, right of the MF area and left of Bonnie's Roof.  The High E access trail is about a 17-min. walk from the Uberfall, and a 13-min. walk from where the East Trapps Connector Trail meets the carriage road.  P1:  Begin the climb in a chimney/stemming corner left of the arete.  Climb up this corner, only until it is possible to traverse up and right across the face, then climb up the face to a fantastic, spacious triangular belay ledge (this is the GT ledge) right on the arete below a large roof.  Belay from natural gear or sling the huge boulder on the ledge.  5.4, 180'.    This pitch was originally split into two by belaying in the corner before heading out onto the face, but it can be easily combined into one with careful rope management.    P2:  This is the money pitch, and is just about as exciting as 5.6... or 5.7 or 5.8 for that matter... can be.  Climb up from the ledge (it's easiest to begin at the left side) and traverse right to the obvious place to turn the corner and make "The Move" to pull the roof - the exposure is immediate and the rock is steep!  Continue up the face past gear, jugs, and fixed pins, trending left back towards the arete, until you top out.  Exhilarating!  5.6, 100'.  Communication between the clifftop and the GT is notoriously difficult here, so plan accordingly.    Descend climber's right from three bolted rap stations with one rope.  Also consider the Directissima variation instead of doing the original first pitch.  Done this way, the climb checks in at 5.9, but you get what you pay for -- a first pitch that rivals the second in terms of quality.

route_description: My personal favorite at this grade.  Often very busy though.  Start left of Minty: from where the trail hits the cliff, walk about 50' left past the thin crack of Snooky's Return to an obvious right-leaning crack.  P1: Either climb the crack (harder) or corners just left to a ledge.  Continue up and step right and then up to a good belay (even with the top of Snooky's). 5.3, 75'.  It's possible to walk right to the rap anchor there if you need to descend.  P2: Climb up the big corner above.  About 40' up, it's easier to work left onto the face instead of staying in the corner.  If you find the moves are harder than 5.4 you need to go left.  Work left on a ledge system to a right-facing corner - climb up this to a comfy belay on the GT ledge. 5.4, 120'.  P3: Climb up a left-facing corner about 10' to a roof, clip an old pin, and avoid it around to the right.  Then up easy ground to another roof - step left at this one (spectacular exposure) and then up to the top. 5.3, 60'.  Descend via the Uberfall Descent (left) or over Snooky's Return (right about 100');  be very careful of climbers below, if you rappel, remembering that climbers have the right-of-way.

parent_name: Great White Icicle Area 
parent_url: /v/great-white-icicle-area/105739745 
route_description: The Great White Icicle is one of the most popular climbs in the Salt Lake area due to the fact it's so close and has multiple pitches of ice that form up very regularly. It's a great lead and a fine climb for new ice climbers. Because of these reasons it's very often crowded, especially on weekends, so be prepared to wait and dodge ice. Always wear a helmet.  Ascent:  The climb is typically done in four pitches. The first pitch climbs a short moderate step (approximately 50') to the large boulder on the right side with a chain belay. From here wander up the snow slope until you reach the base of the ice at the start of the second pitch, a low angle (45-50 degree) 100 foot ramp that leads to the balcony. At the top there is a bolted belay on the left side and a rap anchor on the balcony proper.   The third pitch is known as the bulge and can be climbed on the far left (easiest), center (most common), or right side (infrequent). After approximately 160 feet there is a bolted belay on the left side. (Reaching it may require the belayer to simul climb up to the start of the ice). After approximately 120 feet there is also a belay on the right side. Reaching it can be tricky and is not recommended for the new ice climber. Using this belay will require that another belay be used also on the far right side at the top of the ramp that is below the last curtain.   If using the belay on the left the final pitch can be done from here. The last curtain can be climbed on the left or right. Each have their own mini cruxes. Originally one climbed up the curtain to a short pillar on the left side. With the change in the creek (circa 2000) the pillar is bigger but still requires a bit of careful climbing. From the top of the pillar continue up where one can belay from the trees.  Climbing the right side will require one to climb up the curtain, step to the right and the continue up to the top where one can belay from the trees.  There is also a vertical 20 foot curtain that often forms below the step on the right side. Climbing it can be good fun. However, it is best to let it fully touch down before climbing it.   Descent:  While it is possible to rappel the route, it is not advisable because of the number of other climbers that may be below. Instead, walk up the snow/creek approximate 100' to a level area where a well beaten path will cross the creek (climber's right) and traverse over into the next gully. Descend until well into the trees and it possible to leave the gully on the up canyon side (skier's right). Continue descending next to a slab which brings one back to the near the base.  Trivia: in the 90s Alex Lowe climbed the route car-to-car in 19 minutes while after a heavy snow fall Andrew McLean et. al. skied the route (albeit while belayed). After a heavy snow fall it is possible to bum slide the second pitch.   Edited Jan 2014 to reflect the current conditions.

route_description: This is the bolted line just left of the waterfall.  Usually dry by april.  Because of the water running on this climb 5-6 months out of the year, it is deceptively smooth down low.  Start on the rightward angling ramp, clip the bolt and figure out the tricky sequence.  No, don't hold onto the bolt.  Once you have gotten past the first bolt, continue up past the step on the face to the steep section.  Take a breather.  Sidestep onto the upper face, and now commence to "sweep left".  The line on this climb does not clamber up the ramp, as this turns into 5.5, but stays on the face with the bolts between your hands and feet, as you "sweep left".  This consists of thin smears on micro-flakes, and fingernails of steel.  What makes this part of the climb fun, is that each year, after the freeze/thaw cycles, the flakes have all changed.  I went up there this year (2004) and a micro-flake that I remember from last year, that was integral was gone now.  The upper face has gotten harder, but the crux is still down low.

route_description: The First East Face is a good route with a great view and decent exposure. Although highly vegetated, the First East Face follows a relatively clean line between a majority of the brush. This line makes for a nice outing climbing a staggered, broken crack system separated by alert face climbing. Watch for loose rock.   Approach- From the parking lot locate a weakness over the talus heading towards the JHCOB wall. Follow this for 200 feet to the base of the formation. Head for the North/East corner, from here continue up over dirt and loose rock to a small alcove just South/East of the Outside Corner.   p1- Begin at the wide crack that separates the shale from the quartzite. Scramble and climb up the wide break over loose and dirty rock to a resting ledge set in a small cove. Build a belay here using a small varied crack system.  (65 feet)  p2(a)- Climb straight up from the belay about 10 feet and follow some horizontal cracks and seams aiming right towards the arete. At the corner, join up with a nice splitter finger/hand crack and follow this for about 15 feet to its end. Finish out the short remaining face and build a belay just below a large dirty ledge. (60 feet)  p2(b)- Climb straight up from the belay about 10 feet and follow the horizontal cracks coming shy of the arete by about 15 feet. Climb a rather wide and heavily vegetated crack for 20 feet, break right towards a belay below a large dirty ledge. (60 feet)  p3- Continue up and traverse left to gain a good, short splitter, climb this to its end keeping  right of a large tree and head towards another short and slightly hidden crack. Climb this crack, get onto a face and hit another obvious crack.  Run this up and left until coming just short of the top. Finish left at a tree and horizontal crack system. build belay. (80 feet)  Descent- From the final belay, scramble left of the belay and around the corner of the face to an obvious path that reaches the summit. Walk off to the West on a heavily traveled trail towards the shale layer. Scramble down the final gully ending at the geological sign parking lot.

route_description: This historic route was the first line up Monkey Face.  It begins on the southeast side of the tower.    Pitch 1:  5.6 Scramble up a series of ledges to a ramp up and right to a vertical crack that takes you to the notch formed between the main buttress and Monkey face.  Once at the notch turn the corner and climb up the face using traditional pro, bolts, and fixed pins.  Belay at the left of two anchors on a long ledge.    Pitch 2: C0  Move up an overhanging red face on a bolt ladder into the "monkey's mouth."  Belay from the unique angle-iron anchors.  Pitch 3: 5.7 Move the belay to the east edge of the cave (mouth).  Reach out of the cave and move straight up the face for 25 feet on bolts to a ledge with chains.  This classic pitch is short but airy.  The opening moves have been called "panic point" due to the noticeable exposure.     Pitch 4: 5.5 Ascend the boulder at the belay and move northward.  Step across a small trough and head for the a bolted anchor on the east side of the summit at a ledge.    From here is a 4th class jaunt to the true summit.  Be sure to take in the scenery and take pics for your REI catalog cover shot.  Descent:   Scramble or take a short rappel back to the top of the 3rd pitch.  Another short single rope rap takes you back to the cave (these top 2 raps can be difficult to pull).  From the cave you have several options:  1. Take the stunning and free hanging 2 full 60m rope rappel from the east edge of the cave to 3rd class below.  This is the highlight of the route for many and allows you to also contemplate the insane difficulty of Just Do It.  After this double rope rap you can circle back west to the base of the variation or continue up and over the top of the main buttress on the trail.    2. Take the tyrolean traverse back to the main buttress.  (Requires that you fixed a second rope and rapped in from main buttress onto first pitch, trailed rope up to the cave, and know how to actually do a tyrolean (beyond the scope of this description).    3. Rap the route (not recommended but possible with single 60m)

route_description: This is a lot of fun!  The climb starts on the S. Ridge of Superior. Start at the lowest point on the ridge at the most open spot to avoid bushwacking. 3,000' 5.6 (easier or harder depending on how many boulder problems you decide to do)  Cross over to Monte Cristo easily. Drop down off Monte Cristo (be careful, this is the crux although it's easy 4th)  Now it's up n' down and up again for a long long time until you clamber up Dromedary Peak (don't cheat stay on the ridge).  A heatbreaking descent down, and not as bad as it looks back up to Sunrise (O'Sullivan) Peak.  Down and up again to the summit of the Twins.  From here there are options: -Head down into Broads Fork. Take the ridge or backtrack to the saddle to Sunrise. The slabs straight down are fun, but can be deadly. -Keep on Truckin to Storm Mtn and go down Deaf Smith or Furgison Cyn. Way more fun and scenic! -Try and stay on the ridge of LCC the whole way down (epic) from the Twins  From Alta to the Twin it's about 4-6 miles of ridge climbing

route_description: On the far end of the northwest face, going from the ground to the ledge below the Overhang Bypass, there is a nice low-angle jamcrack. This is a good beginenr's lead and would take whatever protection you might want to jam into it. It's also a decent and fun entry-level solo. The climb starts just down from the "walk up" to the ledge and finishes at the base of the Overhang Bypass.

route_description: This description is only for Upper Right Ski Track. Lower Right Ski Track is treated as separate climbs, so I am listing them that way.  However, I prefer long pitches and chose to climb the both in a single 60M+ pitch.  This requires a 60 or 70M rope and a larger rack but is worth the time and effort.    On intersection Rock, there are three main cracks running diagonally up and left from the base. These are visible from the North side (from the Hidden Valley Campground) and are called, from right to left, Right Ski Track, Left Ski Track, and Half Track. These are plainly visible in the attached photograph.  Right Ski Track is the right-most of the three climbs, and starts as a left-leaning, left-facing dihedral, climbing 60 feet or so to a ledge that may be traversed onto from a scramble up the West end of the Rock.  Below said ledge is Lower Right Ski Track (5.10c).  Above this ledge is Upper RST (5.3).  Access the climb via Lower RST, or scramble up the shoulder of Intersection Rock from the West End, roping up and traversing out left (East-ward) along a sloping ramp to the crack.  Build a belay and get ready to climb.  The route-finding is not difficult, as you will simply follow the crack to the top.  Once up top, sling rocks or set gear to bring up the second.There is no particular crux that I noticed.  The climb is a fun and easy route with some good jamming and stemming.  From the top, head to the West end and rap off.

Near the top, traverse right under an overhang then up again. Surmount the overhang at the top. Beginning this route via "Golden Years" is more interesting. One more thing, the overhang at the top is no more than 5.4; however, one must have the usual five senses.

route_description: I never have figured out quite how to pronounce the name of this climb.  I also have no idea what the hell a buissonier is.  A buisson is a bush.  The nearest I can figure is buissonniere, French for "to play truant or skip school".  In any case, a pretty good climb.  Begin behind campsite (#21).  First moves off the deck are awkward - protect with small nut or TCU to avoid castration from sharp fin of rock below in the event of a fall.  Either jam or lieback the left-angling crack.  Gear belay.  Descent: scramble down chimney to the southwest (a little tricky).

It is just left of the sheer northeast face of this formation.   Climb up the hand and fist crack past a horizontal rail, and then enter the off-width. Left side in, right side smearing on the face will get you up it. It's very fun but gym rats and posers will complain. Continue to a nice alcove with weird horns to sling and belay, or continue up the second pitch - a pretty right-curving crack (feasible as one pitch with a long sling or two). No fixed anchors that I could find but a rappel is easy with some long webbing around those horns.   The first pitch goes at 5.7 (possibly 5.7+ ?), and the second pitch at 5.8.

route_description: One of the best and most accessible of the easier moderates, Double Cross is perhaps the most climbed (i.e, crowded) route in the entire Park. Those who have not yet developed basic jamming technique will find this route quite difficult.  Although easily protected, this route has been the site of several serious injuries and a few fatalities over the years.  Begin by climbing 25' up and then traverse left to gain the main crack.  Continue for another 70' of stellar hand to fist crack.  Belay from 3-bolt anchor.  If crowded (as it often is), consider Double Start (just to the right), Dogleg, or Sexy Grandma.  Descent: Rap to ground (a single 50m rope just barely makes it).  Many, many pages of discussion about the route have been moved to the Double Cross Discussion in the Southern California Forum.

route_description: Geurt's Ridge is a really nice technical route which shoots straight up to the South summit of Mount Olympus.  The rock quality is good, and tons of short finger/hand cracks add to the enjoyment.  As for all routes on Mount Olympus, this has a pretty hefty approach.  Start at the trailhead by Pete's rock, than follow the trail steeply uphill.  Enter the wilderness after 15-20 minutes, and get to the stream crossing after 40-45 minutes.  Above the stream is the so-called "Blister Hill".  Switchback up this, with a rock rib to the right.  This rib is a good landmark for when to leave the Mt. Olympus trail.  Once you reach the level of the top of the rib (when you can see over it down to the city), this is approximately when to exit the trail (60 minutes from the trailhead).  Blaze north through brush towards the rounded ridge.  Aim for just above the cliff bands.  Once on top of the little cliffs, look for a couple of cairns that help guide the way.  From here, keep traversing north, and notice the ridge that starts down below and works all the way to the summit.  Drop down off the rounded ridge to get to the rock (only a small ways downhill).  This part is brushy and makes wearing pants a good idea.  Step onto the ridge, the bushwhacking is over (75 minutes from the trailhead).  This ridge more or less shoots straight up to the summit.  Many breaks in the ridge are encountered along the way.  Most of the lower ridge is 3rd/4th class, so roping up is probably not necessary.  As you cruise up the ridge, more rock bands with nice looking climbing keep rising up from the left in the canyon.  Eventually a beautfiul steep section of rock comes in to view, which provides the first good climbing.    Above this spot it looks like the route is over.  Luckily, the best is yet to come.  A catwalk on the ridge is encountered (nice exposure on both sides), which leads to some more scrambling until a dropoff is reached.  Some slings around a block with rap rings allow a short rap off this tower, or a difficult downclimb might be possible.   Another steeper section of good rock leads eventually to yet another rap over a dropoff.  This one might be really hard to downclimb.  From here, straight forward climbing/scrambling leads to the summit.  Descend via the hiking trail.  If you are not familiar with it, it drops off the ridge to the south a short ways west of the summit.  The trail is hard to find, but quickly gets more pronounced.

route_description: This classic alpine route follows a long, airy quartz and basalt ridge with a couple of knife edge sections and towers.  In warmer weather this is an easy scramble/rockclimb, but with snow and ice it becomes a more challenging alpine climb.  Start early as the route gets a lot of sun.

route_description: This is the furthest right (climber's right) climb not counting Rodan and friends.  You can start near Flea Flicker/Fleeting Glimpse and climb up and right along the easy ramps until you get to the nice finger crack on Neurotica.  I placed a piece here with a runner and made my move up and around the tree in the way.  Then you progress up and right to the roofs.  Climb the roof just past a right-facing headwall, clip the chains from Rodan and continue up the broken face and cracks to the top.  Angle left to the anchors on Hard Knocks.  A few worthy moves, but not a climb to repeat much.

route_description: Locate the obvious arete that divides the north and east faces of the cliff.  Begin left of the arete.  Pitch 1:Face and crack climb up and over the roof (5.6). Continue up easier, broken rock to belay on good ledge atop pillar below slanted roof.  Pitch 2:Climb up right and follow wide crack left of arete to small belay stance on the arete.  Pitch 3:Face climb up the steep, exposed arete, stay out on the arete as much as possible moving at times from one side to the other when necessary.  After clipping a bolt, I seem to remember that there wasn't much protection above it, so if you see a gear placement opportunity, do not pass it up.  Climb to the top of the arete and belay from the trees on top.  Descent:Follow a path left along the top of the wall until you come to a rappel station.  3 single rope, 80 foot rappels to the ground.

route_description: This sport route (6 bolts _ chains) would make a really nice training climb. The first 60' is face climbing on a multitude of good holds, which leads to a small roof which is just enough to get you pumping. Note that the climb starts from a large ledge ~15' up from the bank of the stream. So when rapping down, stop at the ledge!  Beta: There is supposedly a scramble somewhere at the midpoint of Dogwood (see the first photo in this section - the left-slanting shrub-covered diagonal?) - but we found it a little too overgrown to navigate safely. We rapped down from the chains on a 60m rope.

I continued to the top (climb east to attain narcolepsy anchors) and rapped down narcolepsy. This continuation is highly recommended to avoid the walk off to the west. A good crack for the leader trying to break into the grade. It felt a bit soft for a 5.8 to me.

It works through a slot in the roof layer and then angles right, past a tree and finishes within arm's reach of the chains.  The pre-roof crack is fun, just a bit dirty, but fun, and it protects well.  The roof is also fun (not 5.9), but fun.  I felt like 5.8.  Above the roof, it gets dirty, rotten, easy, and almost no gear.  Worth one ascent, no more, no less.

The start of Prune Face is shared with Straight On For You.  Climb the groove up to clip the first bolt.  Surmount the steep section with thin moves, and then begin the fun.  Don't slip right before the third bolt.  After passing the third bolt, achieve the stance below the mid-point "roof", and shuffle left (you can place a small TCO here) to the obvious grooves.  Climb the much easier grooves to the belay anchor, placing small cams and stoppers along the way.  A fun climb, particularly because of the nice, short approach.

route_description: This climb ascends the right side of the slab.  Start on the first half of "Prune Face", then follow the bolts continuing straight up the slab at the small overhang instead of traversing right.  The first section is amazing, especially considering it was originally done with only one bolt!  Thin moves up a groove and over the steep section at the begining place you on the slab proper.  From the stance above the first bolt, move up thin slab climbing with the occasional solid hold thrown in.  You don't want to be falling right before the third bolt.  Once attaining the stance below the small "roof", clip the fourth bolt and start up continuous slab moves to the 8th bolt.  I angled left here to the belay station instead of moving up to clip the last bolt.  All in all, quite the entertaining moderate slab climb.

route_description: Ascending the simplest way up the roof on the right side of the main climbing area to a mantle finish, or a simple traverse to the left once the large holds above the roof are grabbed.  There are many popular variations with increasing difficulty, many of which I hope will be added to the site.    Going over the roof is a little scary the first time, especially for a beginner outdoor boulderer.  The holds are there, but you must feel around on the many chalked surfaces of this section to find them.   To find this climb go to the main chimney and head right around the corner.  Located in front of the large wooden log benches, you will usually find someone or someones working on some variation in this section. Another good landmark is a large diagonal flake located 6 to 9 feet above the ground (and the traverse that goes at V4) which is just to the right of this route.

route_description: Zee Tree Route is a well-bolted face climb located to the right of the Dike route and ascends an independent line for 3 pitches, after which it joins House Calls and Boche-Dope in a left facing book which leads to the base of the crack pitch of the Dike Route.  The climbing is fairly varied. The first pitch, which is the most interesting, starts at a two bolt anchor just where the angle steepens and ascends a short slightly steep section of knobs (2 bolts with old leeper-style hangers), crosses glacier polish (2 bolts) to a miniature roof. Step over the roof (1 bolt) and pass a small tree growing in a solution pocket (Zee Tree). The pitch originally ended at the tree, but to reduce impact on the fragile tree, the route now passes the tree on the right and ascends (5 bolts) to a comfortable stance and a two bolt anchor. This pitch is a full 165 feet.  The angle slackens above and the climbing eases as well. The second pitch is easy (5.5?) face climbing past 3 bolts to a another two bolt anchor. The final pitch is also easy face climbing , though interesting as the angle varies. It heads up and right past 2 bolts, then straight up and ends in a left facing book. This belay requires gear, medium nuts to medium friends.  To exit, climb up the left facing book and belay near the base of the crack pitch on the Dike Route. Either climb this crack (pro to #4 friend) and rappel the east end of Pywiak, or walk off to the west (not recommended).  The route was put up in good style. A mix of eighteen 5/16 and 3/8 inch bolts were placed by hand, on lead, from the ground up, though not in a continuous push. Two others were "filled in" while seconding after leading though originally, to eliminate uncharacteristic runout sections.

route_description: Goldmember is an excellent slab route halfway up Medlicott Dome.  We accessed it by climbing Piss Easy, but other approach options may exist.  Also, the supertopo guide notes that Jake Whittaker put it up freesolo (!) and that it was later bolted by a party unaware of the fact it had been climbed.  The FA expressly gave permission for the bolts to remain, I'd like to thank him for that generousity, so that mere mortals like myself could enjoy this excellent route.  From the large belay ledge atop p2 of Piss Easy, follow the 4" wide golden dike that trends up and left on very polished and slick granite, surmounting a few small overlaps.  Fun thin slab moves all the way to the top, with a couple mantels.  End at a hole in the rock with two bolts equipped with rap anchors.  Descent:  I think you are supposed to rap down and left 50' to the Shagadelic anchors, then do two double rope raps to the ground.  We didn't know this, and tried to go straight to the p1 shagadelic rap anchors directly below on the big ledge.  With 2 60m ropes, I came up 20' short, and had to down solo some 4th class, which was thankfully above a large ledge.  Be aware!  Then, double rope rap to the ground.

route_description: Piss Easy goes up the large crack in the right facing corner.  Use a variety of OW moves and some features on the face.  The low angle keeps the grade moderate.  p1--goes up the corner, surmounting a 2' bulge 3/4 of the way up, 5.8.  Belay on a good ledge.  100'.  p2--Continue up the corner.  The wide crack gets funkier, resulting in easier climbing, but harder to protect.  I wouldn't call it run out though.  150', 5.7.  Ends on large ledge.  The route continues up for a couple more pitches, but we didn't do them, opting to do the slab route Goldmember instead.  There is no easy way down from the ledge atop p2, so you either need to continue up, or leave gear to rap.  (you can rap if you do Goldmember.)  Please add to this description if you've done the entire route.

route_description: A near dead-vertical face with widely spaced bolts, this enjoyable, sustained line will gradually get more difficult and thin as you near the top. Steep jugs, thin crimps, and good movement, Transformer is an interesting, thoughtful climb. Its important to mention that this route is bolted, but gear will be necessary to protect yourself from a potential ground fall. There is a great .75 camalot placement between the second and third bolt, the climbing in that section is easy, but falling before you reach the third bolt would probably be awful.   A 60 meter rope will work fine, but be mindful of your ends.  Transformer is south-facing and very doable during a dry, winter day. That being said, it can be brutal in the middle of July. Beware of hornets on this climb when in season.

route_description: If you park at the "Remnants of an Ancient Sea" pullout, hike up and angle left toward the wall.  You are heading for the main arete between the East Face and the North Face.  When you reach the arete and where the wall meets the scree.  You want to start the climb on the east side (left side) of the arete by a little tree/bush.  Pitch one:Climb up and right to reach the arete, then follow the right side (north side) of the arete up until you come to a BIG ledge.  When I climbed this I had a 60 meter rope, so I am not positive that you can reach this ledge with a 50 meter rope.  If you aren't going to make it, you can easily stop at a couple of points to break this pitch into 2.  Either way, make sure you use long runners to prevent serious rope drag.  Pitch two:(From the Big ledge.)Start to the right of the belay and climb up through cracks staying on the north side of the arete until you reach a feature some call "the cave."  It is an obvious ledge to belay from, now you are on the arete again, with better exposure.  This pitch is easily reached with a 50 meter rope, it isn't too long, however I don't remember its exact length.  Pitch three:Technically you have the option of climbing up onto the east side (left)of the arete, but that isn't why you are climbing this route. So move to the right from the belay back out onto the north face and climb upward.  The climbing finally gets the exposure you were looking for so look around and enjoy.  Follow cracks up to the top.  Again, a 50 meter rope easily reaches the top.  Descent:Hike up and then right (west) where you will find a great trail that leads down to the shale layer which is above the "Remnants..." parking area.  Then down to the pullout.  This route would be three stars if the rock was better on the lower pitch.  It is a great route for the moderate traditional leader.

route_description: This is the most difficult route on the east face of the slips (there are some .10's around the corner).  Very nice midsection with nice smooth surface and a thin crack to get your fingers into.  Then up to the juggy top section that feels steeper than it really is.  Lots to grab up there.  Once you reach the top there is a ledge to stand on while fixing the anchors, so even if this climb comes at the end of the day (after you've done all four on this wall) you can still wear yourself out going up and not worry about being exhausted when you get there.

There is a plate sized bulge in that section that works more as a distraction than anything, but it sure looks good while your on top of it.  Juggy on top.

After the second bolt climb left to the top anchors on top of the shoulder to the right of the summit of the needles eye formation.  Variation: Instead of traversing left after coming out of the eye, climb straight up to the top of the higher summit. This variation brings the climbing into the 5.9 range and causes lots of rope drag. However, it is still a very good climb. A 30 meter rappel lands you on the trash can.  Note: Climb route when low amount of noise in the parking lot is available (not Sturgis week) because climber traverses where belayer can't see climber. Use a third person to spot if needed.

route_description: This is the classic box stem on the far south end of the west face easily visable from the trail head at the parking lot.  Expect tourist gawkers on this route.  There is good reason for them to stare, this is one of the most unique and classic climbs in the country.    Pitch 1: Climb the ramp and short section of 5.8 to get to a big ledge on top of a broken column at the base of the box.    Pitch 2: This is the pitch you've heard about.  Climb up setting gear in the crack on the left when ever you feel like it.  There are some good jams and fingerlocks on your way, but you must stem your legs and in some places pure stemming is the only option.  Move fast and fight the burn.  Easier for taller people, but the box narrows as you get higher.  Belay at the top of the lefthand column.  They say no move is harder than 5.9, but endurace and pain threshold are the keys here!    P3: Climb the near-vertical hand crack directly above the belay 40 ft to large ledge with two bolts. (5.8 fun)  P4: Jam the left crack on the ledge (you do not step off the ledge to reach this crack) for about 15 ft until you can clip a pin on the left wall. The pin looked marginal so I placed a bomber large stopper. Traverse straight right on good feet to the right crack. Now place some small wires and balance up to the roof, place a small cam and crank over on finger locks (10a crux). Climb over one more small roof and a short #.75 C4 crack (5.9) to a stance with two bolts. ~90ft  P5: Climb the rotten chimney directly above (5.4) until you reach a large ledge directly below the summit. Be extremely careful not to knock any of the loose blocks in the chimney down as they will funnel directly into the stacked up climbers waiting to climb the first two pitches! From here you can climb the easier looking chimney to the left(5.4?), or the hard-to-protect crack/face directly in front of you (5.7) to two bolts. Once again be very careful what you pull on. ~150 ft  The loose rock on the last pitch is avoidable, just something to be aware of.  The standard rap descent is on the far side of the tower. It would be possible to rap the route with 2 60m ropes but you would risk dropping your rope or rocks on someone climbing below.

route_description: The first time I was on this climb was mid June in 100F heat.  Perhaps not the best conditions, because I only got hotter as I got higher.  The climb starts with the technical crux, a polished finger crack.   Thankfully this is short and leads to a very good ledge and rest.   If you ever want to hear sticky rubber squeak, this is your climb!  What follows is a great hand jamming sequence, up to the midway point of the climb.   The crack slowly widens to wide hands, then to off width and finally to a polished chimney.  When you reach the anchors, take deep breaths and marvel at this classic climb, and wonder why size 8 friends never caught on.

route_description: This route has two stellar classic  pitches(P1 and P2) clean and superb quality rock. After that rock quality deteriorate significantly. A lot of loose and unstable rock in upper part of this climb. P1: Start on pedestal 15 feet left from Anathema . Tight hands (10a) quickly become wide hands - and than 25 feet of 5.7 secure but unprotected  chimney. ~80feet - hanging belay in hand size crack above the rappel slings.  You can just do first pitch and rappel down.  P2:  80 feet    5" offset splitter OW almost all the way . This pitch should have 5 stars out of 5. Starts with short  6" (#6Friend)  leaning crack which after 10 feet become straight vertical  5"  (#5Camelot sise)   You can walk up  #5 Camelots  easily all the way. Plus you  have one  piton about 30 feet up from the start and you can place some small gear ~1"  . I climbed this pitch  left side in  all the way. And it works fine. The left  knee almost all the way in. My wife followed same way. I am curious - anybody climbed this thing as right side in or straight in? Gear for P2 in order of appearance: #6 Friend, #5 Friend,  #0.75 camelot, piton,  #4 camelot, #5 camelot, #5 camelot. Hanging Belay in alcove with small pro ( green/red aliens)  P3. Exit from alcove - 5 feet horizontal traverse ( 10a)  left to reach vertical vertical thin hands crack. This short traverse it was wet and hard. Thin hands crack is easy and rock quality is quickly deteriorate. Climb to the small trees with old slings. ~80 feet. Now you at the same level as top of Catchy Corner. You can double rope rappel to the top of Vendetta P1 . If you do so- add some webbing to the tree.   p4. class 4 ramp to the base of p5. loose rock, dirts, slippery- we did it as simulclimb with some pro.  P5. Tree options:  a. Intimidating 10c OW in Left corner with overhanging exit to the top. looks mach harder ( did not try)  b. Thin hands crack exit 10-  Looks OK, but in the very end on top of this crack huge dead tree brunch is ready to fall on you and your belayer ( did not try)  c.

This boulder has a 10 ft tall corner leading up to a roof. Above the roof is a crack that widens from hands to off-width. This is The Gauntlet. To set a toprope, scramble around to the right. You could maybe boulder it if you want, with some pads protecting the rock below, but you probably won't since you might fall on your head.  Start with finger locks and liebacking in the corner. Undercling out the roof and sink a great handjam at the lip, then a fist jam, and then you flip upside down and throw your foot in above you. Use hand-stacks to scoot your foot jam up. Eventually you'll need to un-invert which is the crux of the route. A route that's sure to give you washboard abs in no time.

route_description: First or one of the first Yosemite free 5.11. Later was downgraded to 10d, since block of rock fell off leaving place for hand jam - making crux sequence shorter.  I found this climb good and clean and underrated in quality in Reid Book. At least one star out of 3 would be fair.  Pithch 1: Still hard 10d off the ground: first 15 feet with potential decking if your  gear placement is bad. fingertips, figers and good foot work  bring you to good handjam.  After that climb relatively easy wide cracks which become higher up 5.8 chimney. 150feet. 2 bolts Anker ( shared with Sacherer) Pitch 2: ( link p2&3 in the book) Start easy climbing inside of the chimney (5.5) and after 70-80 feet you reach the ledge where you have the choice: a) climb wide crack in the corner or b) climb crack in the left wall with thin start. I climbed left one which can be rated 5.8- 5.9. 150 feet. Natural ancor. [ Added Feb 2015:-  climbed right variation of this pitch all the way from ledge to belay of pitch3. Way more classic , but little harder- probably goes at 5.10] Pitch 3:  Start with  easy climbing to  5.7 chimney. Clinb to the top of the Pinnacle to new 2  rappel bolts.  We rappel down  and left  to top (third pitch) of La Esuella with one 70m rope. And from there tree more rappels to the ground.  From  the top of the Slack the other option to rappel down "Slack Left"  with 2 ropes. Also you can use this chance and check ( you can TR) last pitch of Slack Left - 10b Chimney/Flare/OW - older brother of Ahab

route_description: This is a classic Chuck Pratt testpiece - a must-do for anyone interested in historic wide cracks. The crux climbs more like a chimney than an offwidth, so throwing a toprope on Moby Dick, Ahab is good training for it. The Slack Left requires less endurance then Ahab, but the short crux section is a step up in terms of pure difficulty.  Pitch 1 (5.9) - Start up the double thin cracks in a corner. They are often filled with munge, so you may need to dig them out to place pro. Climb up through the tree to reach the start of an offwidth. Fear not, there is a crack inside the offwidth which can be jammed and sidepulled. Eventually the crack will widen to a chimney which is a bit dirty. A short section of chimney ends the pitch. There are two options for the belay. Either sit on the ledge on the right wall of the dihedral, or belay in the back of the chimney off two pitons. I chose the ledge because it seemed more comfortable, but you can also make your choice based on whether you wish to belay in the sun or the shade.  Pitch 2 (5.8) - Continue up the chimney towards the roof. Small cams protect in the back. At the roof traverse left and climb up a short loose section before rejoining the corner. Alternatively, if you're feeling burley you can climb straight through the roof using the 5" crack (probably at least 5.10). From here there's another section of offwidth up the dihedral, and same as p1 there's a crack within the crack, making the climbing easy. Belay at two pitons and gear on a ledge left of the corner.  Pitch 3 (5.10b) - This is the pitch that separates the men from the boys. The first two pitches are somewhat easy and average in quality. The final pitch is fiercely difficult and absolutely fantastic. If you're not feeling up for it, you can always tunnel through to the final pitch of The Slack Center, and finish on a pitch of 5.8, making for the most moderate way to climb to the top of The Slack. Otherwise, collect yourself and begin up the long chimney. I stayed near the edge because there was water running down the chimney further back. There are lots of good edges which make the climbing very easy (5.5 - 5.6). There's not really any pro, but if this section doesn't feel totally casual you're probably way in over your head. No matter what path you choose through the chimney, you'll eventually be forced to a inverted V-slot near the edge. A #5 Camalot protects the initial squeeze chimney moves and a #4 nicely protects the crux where you must partially exit the chimney. Like many wide cracks, it's easy to stay stuck in place, but making upward progress is very strenuous. The crux is less than a body length but you must fight for every inch. Resist the urge to wedge your hips in the chimney to rest. Once you're wedged, it's very difficult to get moving again.  After the crux you gain a stance on a sloping ledge, but it's not quite over yet. The final obstacle is an overhanging flake that is *just* too tight to squeeze behind. The Don Reid guidebooks marks this section as "5.9" on the topo. Maybe I was just so exhausted from the crux below, but this felt more like a 5.9+, of the very most sandbagged type imaginable. Being a small person is extremely helpful here. This will be very difficult (possibly even the crux?) for really big dudes. It's also more difficult to protect than the lower crux. I was able to squeeze my chest in a short ways up and reach in deep to place a #6 Camalot. If you're too big to squeeze in here and reach back for pro, this could be very hard to protect without Valley Giants or Big Bros. However you manage, wiggle and squirm your way up the thing until the crack widens enough to finally take a deep breath. Just another 20 feet of easy wide chimney with lots of features and you'll be mantling on to the summit of The Slack - a very small feature compared to the behemoth it leans against, but an excellent climb and proud accomplishment nonetheless.  Descent - Rappel with two ropes. I prefer to swing over to the anchors atop p3 of La Escula, rather than rap the route and deal with old pitons and webbing. There's a tree that might snag your ropes, but it's easy to lead over and fix the problem. From p3 of La Escula, believe it or not, just one more rappel (with 2 60m ropes) gets you back to the ground.

route_description: The fist pitch is a great practice aid climb and, by far, the crux of the route. Steep and challenging, make sure you have your pendulum skills in order (follower too!!) and have some hooks in your pocket for the top. The last four adventure pitches follow a vegetated ledge system up and left to the very obvious (and only) Ponderosa. A fun day out on El cap with a great view.   P1: 150 feet C2 or 5.10 C1. Underneath a huge roof, follow third class ledges up to where you can lean out to the left and clip a bolt as your first piece. Lower out and swing left to an arete. Make your way up to a small corner until you are about even with your first bolt. Start climbing out left some more, over the arete and out from underneath the roof, until you eventually reach the bolt ladder.  Six bolts take you to some ledges where you can hook or 5.10 free to the top   P2. 140 feet 5.8. Follow 4th class ledges out left, clip a bolt as your first piece, make two 5.8 moves, then 4th class it up to the next set of three bolts.  P3: 120 feet 4th. Head out left on 4th class, pass a bolted belay (which is the start of Native Son), then head a little down on more 4th class. Loose and vegetated.  P4: 120 feet 5.8. Some easy 5th class brings you to a large right facing dihedral of dark, broken rock. Chimney, stem, jam and jug your way up to another bolted belay.   P5: 100 feet 5.9. A short 5.9 lieback brings you up on to another huge ledge and to El Cap Tree. Watch your rope among the loose rock. Pass the tree, and you'll eventually reach another bolted rap anchor.   Two full-length rappels with two 60 meters ropes from the end of P5. Or two 140 foot rappels from the end of Pitch 3. Or one 150 foot rappel from the end of P1.

parent_url: /v/rixons-pinnacle/107409622 
route_description: This historic route is noted as being the first 5.10 in the Valley, although it was initially rated 5.9 by Robbins when he lie-backed the crux offwidth in 1960!  The route follows the impressive chimney system on the right side of Rixon's Pinnacle. There are 3 starting variations. There is essentially a giant chimney in the corner which is divided in half by a protruding flake. To the right of this flake is the original route, which is a 10a offwidth famous for being wet. Climbing to the left of the flake is the Klemens Variation (5.10c, FA: Mark Klemens, 1970) which is noted as "10c hands" in the Reid guide. This is the variation I took and really it's more of a flared, shallow, overhanging chimney with tight hands in the back and a tricky finish. The third option is the Final Decision (5.11b, FA Anders Lundahl and Eva Selim, 1981) which climbs a flake around the corner to the left. Regardless of which start you choose, the first pitch is the crux of the climb.  The second pitch climbs out an intimidating looking overhang in the chimney and then ascends the slightly flared squeeze for another 70 feet. It's not as hard as it looks (it really is 5.8) and protects in the back with big cams. Above, climb some low angle double cracks to a belay ledge. This pitch is excellent.  The third pitch climbs through a weird bulge which leads to a filthy slot and vertical bushwhacking. Then make a traverse right into a cool tunnel  past a giant wedged block. At the top you have to claw your way through more trees. Belaying the second is a pain on this pitch because the rope likes to get pinched in a constriction at the top. I had pull up enough slack to walk over to the other side of the ledge, build an anchor, and then come back and belay near the top of the chimney.  This ledge I think is technically the end of the East Chimney route, but if you want to summit Rixon's Pinnacle you can do one more pitch of 5.7 up the corner past a couple trees.  The descent is kind of interesting. The Reid guide shows a 2 bolt anchor on the ledge at the top of P3. These are ancient 1/4" bolts and one of them has fallen out (the bolt hanger is still dangling from the rap slings). We rapped off a tree that's a bit further up the corner. Two ropes gets you to the huge tree out on the face straight down and left. Another double rope rap from this tree gets you to the ground. Bring extra webbing.  If you go to the summit there is also a rap off the left side of Rixon's, down the West Face. You need two ropes for this as well.

route_description: This is a fun route which used to be a lot more popular until a major rockfall scared everyone off. Unlike the East Chimney route, the West Face is more directly under the fall zone. There's no flattened hangers, rock scars on the wall, damaged trees, or any other signs really of rock hitting the route. So I think most of the rockfall maybe impacted the slabs higher up Middle Brother and deflected out away from the wall. Due to the lack of traffic in the past 20 years, nature has begun to reclaim this one. Expect to climb through some brush filled cracks, although overall I'd say it's cleaner than the East Chimney route.  The route begins to the right of a small pillar just below the big arching right-facing corner. The climb follows cracks across the face, turning the right side of the roof at the top of the corner, and then enters the big left-facing dihedral that leads to the summit of Rixon's.  Pitch 1: Start with steep hand/fist jams in a corner and then move right to fingers up a flake. This thin flake felt pretty tough for 5.9, first thing in the morning with cold fingers. Above move right on slabs to an old bolted anchor (best backed up by a cam).  Pitch 2: The crux pitch. Climb up the left side of a flake to a high piton. Clip it and then downclimb a few feet and traverse right across the face. This involves a wild stem which Don Reid calls 10c. In truth, this move could be anywhere from 5.9 to 5.12, depending on your height. I'm about 5'8" and 5.10+ felt about right for me, though it's difficult to grade such a thing. After this you cruise up easy cracks to another bolted anchor.  Pitch 3: This one was my favorite on the climb. Climb up some flared cracks until your up under the roof. The traverse under the roof is easier than it looks and it's pretty fun and exposed. Belay at another bolted anchor at a small stance after the traverse.  Pitch 4: Up the steep but feature corner to more jam-cracks. Belay at the tree on a ledge. We linked this pitch with the final one.  Pitch 5: A overhaning and somewhat awkward handcrack in the corner leads up to a final grunt up a chimney/off-width.  To descend, make 3 rappels back down the west face with two ropes. From the top of pitch of 5 we rapped to the top of pitch 3 and then straight down to an anchor consisting of 5 old bolts, 2 pitons and a whole mess of webbing.

route_description: This is a fantastic route that has not seen much traffic in recent years due to major rockfall.  The entire route is capped by a huge roof (above which a rockfall scar is clear), and for this reason most of the climb is not only unaffected, but also sheltered from future rockfall.  However, you will find that the first two pitches have been affected.  I don't know what they were like before, but presently there are some loose blocks, flakes, and other features on these pitches which must be navigated.  There is good gear to be had, however, and if you tread lightly, you're likely to be OK -- just try to be careful not to pull off a big loose block onto yourself or your belayer.  I also don't recommend bivying at the base.    P1 & 2:  Link these with a 60m rope and judicious use of runners.  This puts you at a huge belay ledge and under the protection of the roof.  The rap anchors are modern but have clearly been struck by rocks.  They appear safe to use and at least worked for us.  On the way up this long pitch you'll encounter lots of loose flakes and a bolt that has been flattened.  5.9.  P3:  This is a long, hard pitch.  5.10d liebacking up a corner with exactly one handjam rest and exactly zero stem rests.  Sometimes wet, always pumpy.  120' or so.  P4:  This is a totally rad pitch of 5.8/5.9 that hand traverses out a series of huge wedged flakes.  Savor the exposure and bring a few large cams and long runners to protect it.  Easily link it into the next pitch if you runner it well.  50' or so.  P5:  Strenuous overhanging fists to hands in the corner.  5.10c, 50' or so.  P6:  Perhaps the true crux of the route?  This pitch is not to be missed.  Starts off as hands and quickly goes to enjoyable fists, then enjoyable handstacks (new #5 Camalot size), then very difficult armbars/liebacks (new #6 Camalot).  If you're flexible you can stem through some of this El Matador style.  The bolts on this pitch have been (appropriately) chopped -- the pitch can be well protected with modern large cams.  5.9 old school.  A double-rope rap will get you to the top of the long 10d corner (just barely with two 60m ropes).  Another rap to the big ledge below this pitch, and a final double-rope rap to terra firma.

route_description: This 11' OW roof crack to squeeze has lots of helper holds that make it much easier than it appears. The crux is probably the squeeze exit. Big folks will have problems here. Start 11' back under the roof at a blocky pod, get the feet over your head and move to a big, sharp, positive flake  type feature at the edge of the crack. Work out to the lip and squeeze through. The landing has been leveled and the one drawback is how close to the ground the crack is.

After another ~35' the chimney (5.8) will begin to pinch down to take fists, then cupped hands, and finally hands, all the while arching and steepening.  This is a wild and pumpy crux section that does not let up until you turn the flake at the top of the crack.  Pull over the small roof/step on good holds, hold down the pump and gun up a thin crack in a shallow dihedral for the chains. Either rap with two ropes, or rap on a single rope to the anchors above Cristina (down and climber's left), and rap again from here to the ground.  Run a couple of laps on the beginning lieback section of Cristina for a bonus.

route_description: This is classic route that has not seen much traffic. The entire route is following right facing corner from pitch 2 to the end. Considered as a good step forward on the road to Twilight Zone  supertopo.com/climbing/thread.... After climbing this route twice I still think this is true 10c, and despite that all individual moves there is  easier that start of Generator Crack - you do crux section in the middle of pitch 3 with huge rack and you already not fresh. No way it is 5.9  - it is  5.10 Using one 70m rope is a best for climb and rappel this route. With 60m rope you can have down-climb several feet while rappelling p3   P1. Dirty and not well defined pitch. Bad pro. Start from the tree. First move is very insecure. My partner started on my shoulders to reach a jug.  Do not stop at the tree with the rappel slings, - but continue to the  right facing corner - the base of pitch 2. Gear belay.  100' , 5.7-5.8.  P2. This is stellar  off fingers- thin hands pitch.  100', 10c, Two bolts belay. double Red aliens,  Camalots 2 #0,75 2#1, 2#2 2#3, nuts. There is a new bolt 30 feet up on this pitch.  P3. The crux pitch. It has no well defined  cruxes, but I felt two harder sections at about one third and two third of the  of this pitch. Most of the pitch is easier to stay right side in, except of last 20 feet , where is thin crack appears on the right side which I used for small gear. You can walk #5C4 Camalot all the way except of first 25 feet.

Climb up the corner that's half rock and half munge to reach some scary thin flakes wedged in a chimney. Squeeze up between the flake and the outside wall to reach some easier terrain. Climb past a tree with a bunch of rap slings on it and build a gear anchor (nuts, small-medium cams) at a stance just above the tree.  The second pitch is pretty much all chimney climbing and is considerably cleaner than the first. The crux is a "roof" where the chimney pinches down to a tight squeeze and it requires some thoughtful moves to wiggle past. There is another constriction above that is similar but easier. Belay at the new bolted anchor at the top of the Mitten.  Rappel from the summit with two ropes. One 70m rope doesn't quite make it but it is possible to downclimb the first few feet of the Right Side Route.

route_description: The Steck-Salathe truly deserves its status as one of the "Fifty Classic Climbs of North America".  Everything from the climbing itself to the many stories of adventure had on the north face of the Sentinel makes this climb a must-do for any aspiring Valley climber -- if not a route to be repeated again and again, it certainly should at least be seen as a rite of passage.  The climb's reputation for being long, wide, and physical is well deserved, but the quality of that climbing, the position one achieves, and the overall sense of adventure the route offers should not be understated.  On the first ascent in 1950 Allen Steck and John Salathe reached the top of the Flying Buttress (the first half of the route) in two days, and took another three to reach the summit (Royal Robbins made the second and third ascents a few years later).  Today the route is commonly done by free-soloists in the lesser part of a morning; but this is also the climb that nearly resulted in the deaths of Dean Potter and Timmy O'Neill (a fantastic account of their antics appeared in one of the climbing mags a few years back), and did take the life of beloved Derek Hersey.  Most parties should expect a very full day even with a first light start, but fast parties could certainly make it down for dinner if they move efficiently and link pitches.  Originally rated 5.9, the route has been upgraded to 5.10b which is much more like it.  Nevertheless, the 5.10 sections aren't too bad -- it's all those 5.8 and 5.9 wide pitches that present the true crux of the route.  There are many ways to pitch out this climb; this description describes my experience on it.  Approach by parking at the Four Mile Trailhead.  Follow this trail for a long half-mile to a point on the trail where a narrow, tree-shrouded talus slope heads up into the woods.  This is sometimes marked by a cairn, but it is fairly easy to find: if in doubt, continue east on the main trail for a minute or two to an obvious stream bed (sometimes dry late in the season) and then backtrack 100-200 feet to the talus.  Head up a well-defined climber's trail in the talus until it eventually dead-ends at the base of the Sentinel at a steep, wide, west-trending ramp.  This is a convenient place to rack up and stash the packs.  Follow this ramp up until it eventually turns into a narrow system of catwalk-like ledges that weave back and forth up the north face of the Sentinel.  This amazing passage (reminiscent of the approach to Hobbit Book in Tuolumne) gains about 1/3 of the height of the Sentinel via simple 3rd and 4th class scrambling.  It's hard to get lost on this ramp system, and eventually it opens up to a small, loose area near the western edge of the face.  Continue scrambling up until you reach the base of a significant right-facing corner with, yes, a wide crack.  This is the start of the route -- you can't scramble any higher.  P1: A 60' right-facing corner with a wide crack in it.  This can be negotiated with squeezing and OW skills, but I found it easier to lieback.  5.8, strenuous.  I was glad to have a #4.5 Camalot (#5 C4).  This leads to a belay stance which I skipped.  Step right and continue up some 5.8 cracks to another stance and belay -- a long pitch.  P2: Climb a touch more 5.8 past some fixed gear, then easier terrain, then a brief finger crack, then wandering climbing up a gully system to some final wide cracks and a belay below the base of the Wilson Overhang.  Another long pitch, 5.8.  P3: The Wilson Overhang.  Climb up an ever-steepening chimney/corner system with a difficult to reach hand crack in the back.  Eventually one must commit to either jamming and squeezing awkwardly or stemming out a ways with little pro.  There are good face holds for doing the latter.  Pull the overhang and climb easier ground up to a belay on a pedestal.  This pitch is accurately rated 5.10a but is not the crux of the climb.    P4: Climb up an absolutely horrendous 5.9 squeeze and then traverse right and up to a belay at the base of a huge gully/chute system.  Alternatively (highly recommended), skip the squeeze in favor of an unprotected 5.8 flake out right.  The squeeze may very well be the crux of the route -- UGH.  P5 & P6: Climb one of many crack systems for the next two pitches up the gully/chute until it is possible to tunnel through the tip of the Flying Buttress to the left.  This is a good area to simulclimb or pass other parties as there are many avenues.  5.8-5.10 depending on how you go.  Belay at a rap station on the east side of the Flying Buttress -- this is the halfway point and after this retreat becomes more difficult.  Do a short (40') rap off the anchor to another anchor at the base of a steep crack system.  I guess you can also downclimb this section?  Looked difficult.    P7: Ascend the steep and difficult crack system up to an obvious belay -- this is an interesting and challenging pitch.  5.9.  P8: Face climb up and right, then wander sharply back left and up to a belay below a long corner/slot that leads up into The Narrows.  There are several fixed pieces protecting this pitch, but small/medium wires work well too.  5.9 and a somewhat heady change of pace from all the thrutching thus far.  Don't worry -- its all thrutching the rest of the way from here.    P9: This corner to flare to chimney is rated 5.10b which would lead one to believe its the crux of the climb, but it goes quite well, especially if you're willing to leave the security of the gear in the corner and stem and chimney your way up it a little to the outside.  The pitch links very easily into the next pitch, the Narrows, and this is what we did.  P10:  The Narrows.  If you skipped the 5.9 squeeze after the Wilson Overhang in favor of the 5.8 flake, then this is the unquestionable crux of the route.  The Narrows was originally climbed by aiding up a bolt ladder on the outside of the slot, but ever since Robbins' ascents, the way to go has been right up into that hole.  Approaching it, unlike Astroman's Harding Slot, is relatively easy.  In fact, you can get most of your upper body into the Narrows while your lower body is still comfortably back-footing in the wider chimney below.  The problem is advancing the next yard or so:  One must drop one's feet and figure out some way to make upwards progress in a squeeze chimney using only body parts from the hips up.  I managed this by using the back of my head on the back wall to pull my body upwards while simultaneously exhaling, then taking a deep breath to hold that position while I groped for a higher purchase with the back of my head.  Hey, it worked.  Gear for inside The Narrows really isn't necessary, but a fist-size cam (#3.5 Camalot/#4 C4) works well to protect the initial moves.  For most of this you feel pretty alone with only the sound of your own gasping, and the tinkling sound of the hangers on the old aid bolts blowing freely in the wind on the outside of the slot, for company.  Perhaps you'll wish you were out there hanging from those bolts, but perservere -- eventually things will start going a little more quickly.  At last you can stem up out of The Narrows to an incredibly exposed position high on the upper face of the Sentinel.  Peer down at the old bolt ladder, and the valley floor two thousand feet below.  A few more feet of easy climbing leads to a nice belay.  5.9?  Yeah, sure.  P11: At this point a stout looking pine tree appears way above.  This actually is the location of the final real belay on the climb.  Not much further, huh?  Continue up a fun 5.7 chimney to a very cool belay at bolts on top of a chockstone.    P12: Continue up the chimney until forced to pull out left through a steep section at a hangerless bolt (plenty of gear to back it up).  Belay where convenient.  5.8.  P13:  Aim for the tree.  Head up and left through a very steep, but short, section of hand or fist cracks (switching between them where necessary).  Some of this rock is fairly low quality, but after one last little mantle into the dirt and pine needles, you can taste victory.  Belay at the big tree.    P14:  An easy pitch continues up the east-trending ramp at low 5th class, then steps around the corner and belays just below the summit.    Descent:  Before attempting this descent for the first time, take into account the amount of daylight you have remaining.  If it's dark already, consider waiting it out and beginning at first light.  You should try to do at least the first two thirds of the descent in the daylight.  Part 1: Follow a passage east through manzanita and boulders until it turns into a huge gully that heads down to the east.  Follow the obvious trail along the southern (right) wall of this gully until it eventually begins switching back down the center.  This gully is often loose and very steep at times and requires much care to follow the trail, which is the easiest path.  At one point a rappel is reached, but this is not necessary -- there is a 4th/low-5th passage down just before reaching the rap, but it appears highly improbable from above.  Eventually you will reach a stream which must be crossed to reach the second part of the descent.  Note: This stream is the one that crosses the Four Mile Trail just after the talus on the approach; it is also visible (as water streaks/wet sections of rock) from Camp 4 when looking up at the valley wall just left (east) of the Sentinel.  The stream is spring-fed and safe to drink from at this point on the descent -- a good thing to know when planning for how much water to carry on the climb.  Part 2: After crossing the stream, begin heading north (left) on steep slabs.  The easiest passage eventually forces you to the far east (right) side of the slabs as you're descending.  The base of the slabs terminate in dense trees.  Part 3: Continue scrambling down and east (right) along the base of the slabs to a non-descript point at which you enter the trees.  Finding the path of least resistance is difficult even in the daylight -- expect some bushwhacking.  You can more or less head north and west to reach the climber's trail and the Four Mile Trail, but if you left equipment at the base of the ramp, you'll have to cut sharply back west to reach that point.

route_description: Braille Book is an awesome route perched way up high at the top of the Cathedral gully. Named for the many knobs that would "allow even a blind many to climb it", this is some fun climbing! An extra bonus to the extremely enjoyable climbing is belaying with a ringside seat to the two Cathedral Spires and Yosemite Valley spread out below you. Although it comes with a bit of a grunt approach, it's well worth the effort for such a nice route. Get up early, this one is popular!  P1) Climb steep and featured wall just right of right-facing corner system. 130'  P2) Jam a crack that heads up and left into the corner. Continue in wide (fist) crack and belay at a small tower with slings. 100'  P3) Climb up crack to right of corner, that dumps you into a slick chimney (watch out tricky move!). Continue up the chimney to belay on small shelf on left at the base of right-arching offwidth crack. Long pitch 185'  P4) Climb right-arching offwidth crack up and right to a shelf. You can continue 20' up to another shelf via a nice and obvious crack. 60'  P5) Climb up face around the corner to the right (tricky!) crossing up and right to gain the top of the buttress above. 90'  P6) Climb up featured face, up and left across the face, headed for the top. Lots of places to go here. Jugs at the top.  Descent: Scramble off the back and then come around to descend gully. Beautiful hike down!

route_description: A fun and unique route, with the rare chance for the some well-protected bolt clipping in the second pitch.  P1. Start straight up as per West Country, belaying just at the bottom of the MONSTER flake.  P2. Climb under, then through the flake.  There's very little pro in there, but it's really easy and you won't go far with a fall.  Exit the flake in about 80 feet, where there are two bolts (optional belay).  Best to clip one of the bolts and keep going - clinging up the side to the top of the flake.  Belay on top from two bolts.  P3. A nice long face climb past 9 bolts to a 3 bolt belay.  Some of the bolts look a little old.  P4. A short runout face rejoins West Country on it's final pitch.  Undercling an overlap until the crack runs out and the angle gets low.

This is the crux pitch and the most fun.  5.6-5.7 sustained lieback/finger crack climbing for almost 100 feet to a two bolt anchor.  Good pro most of the way.  Great.  P3. Slightly runout face climbing past a few bolts  to a two bolt anchor.  P4. More fun liebacking.  The angle is much lower here, but placing pro is slightly awkward.  Set up a belay after the crack runs out and the angle drops to 3rd class.

route_description: Nice Offwidth.  Note the grade of 5.8+ os for the OW, and the climb could feel harder if you've never done this sort of climbing before.  IT's a nice one that has reasonable rests and won't shred the aspiring OW climber, but at least short-sleaves may be advised anyway, as opposed to bare-back or in a tank top.  On the right hands side of Showshed wall, as seen in this picture, there is a tall sunny buttress split in two by a nice OW crack. The climb starts up past a few mountain Mapples to reach a slot that gets cleaner and more solid with progress. Fist-jamming gives way to arm bars, knee locks, and heel-toe technique, until the steep moves up top that are beat with pockets deep inside the crack and a good left-hand sidepull out on the left face.   The top-anchor or TR can be set with any of the various elements of a standard rack.

Belay in a shady alcove,  start up a slick face squeeze with a finger crack on the wall that takes good pro from #2 camalot to finger sizes.  Pull out into handcrack and face on good knobs.  Turns to lower angle wide fist, with good feet on the face.    Then get down to business as you pull into a squeeze.  A helmet will hose you here.  There is a good horizontal rail that you can get gear in, which will help keep the rope running outside the crack.  My partner somehow got a #4 camalot deep in the crack.  I could barely retrieve it with my nut tool.    With your feet on that good rail, commit to the bombay squeeze.  My partner led this right side in, I followed left side in.  squirm till you hit some thank god rails.    A couple more easier chimney moves lead to pulling over, and easy slab to the top.

route_description: West Arete is an obscure backcountry Sierra route that deserves more traffic. It takes its path up one of the most complex and intimidating mountain faces in the range, the west/southwest side of Mt. Winchell. Climbing this route is a considerable commitment and a great adventure for an experienced party. Despite it's Grade III, 5.8 rating and understated description of difficulties listed in a popular guidebook, we found 4th-5th class approach, incredible exposure, steep terrain, and eleven long (150+ feet) and mostly sustained pitches, only a couple of which were easier than 5.7. Most of the pitches included at least one 5.7+ section while two stretches felt like 5.9. Hence, this route is not recommended for 5.8 trad leaders. Falling and getting injured on this route will present a major rescue challenge. So, don't fall!  This route (or one of its flavors) was first climbed by prolific Galen Rowell and Warren Harding in May 1976. It features mostly clean rock and varied climbing: steep face moves on positive holds, pumpy liebacks, jamming, stemming, knife edge ridge traversing and chimneys. It maintains its sustained nature throughout and ends on the northwest ridge of the mountain approximately 100' below the pointy summit. Protection is good: lots of nut-eating cracks and opportunities for smaller cams. Belay stations are usually comfortable. It's most striking characteristic, which, in my opinion, makes it classic, is that it unravels in front of you as you progress. Once you gain the arete, just follow the path of least resistance.  Instead of giving a detailed pitch by pitch description, I'd list route highlights and give pointers that will help to climb the route while maintaining its adventurous nature.  Once you rope up, go up and left through flakes and crack systems. First two pitches will feature stretches of 5.8 and 5.9 climbing. We found the crux to be on the 2nd pitch where you have to lieback a finger crack up a steep face and stem on insignificant footholds for approximately 20 feet. At first, it will not seem that you're climbing on an arete. However, after the second pitch, this will change. Eventually, you will find yourself tip-toeing on a knife edge and walking on a foot-wide ridge (not recommended for people with vertigo problems). One particular section of the ridge is so sharp, you have to crawl past it on all fours. Approximately half way up, there is a steep and intimidating gendarme. It may be possible to bypass it on the right (we didn't try) or climb on its left side up a very steep face (scary!) with sloping holds and thin cracks. Exposure here is tremendous. As you near the top of the gendarme, there will be a committing move above pro that goes at 5.8+. Past this move, you will regain the ridge proper for easier climbing. Don't forget to occasionally look around and enjoy this outrageous place. On the upper half of the route, it should be easier to bypass certain difficulties on the right side of the arete. When the southwest chute (to your right) comes to its end below the summit headwall, look for a near-vertical chimney/crack system on the right side of the arete. It will place you near the intersection of West Arete and Northwest Ridge. Continue up and right Northwest Ridge for a couple more pitches until the summit.

route_description: The entire route entails some challenging but very fun diverse climbing. The crux 10.b lies on the Seventh pitch. It is definitely a Classic and must DO!  Total of seven technical Pitches with an additional 300' feet of Class 3ish to reach the Summit proper.  Approach: Scramble up the right side of the pedestal (3rd class) to the bottom of the route.   P1(5.9, ~100'): Climb ~30 feet of blocky 5.6, then head up the crack just left of the arete. Belay at the "ear".   P2(5.10a, ~100'): Climb the crack straight above the "ear". Fun face moves to link crack systems. Belay at ledge.   P3(5.9, ~100'): Continue up, traversing left on the obvious sloping ledge below the orange lichen-covered bulge. Belay at the base of the "Triple Cracks".   P4(5.9, ~120'): Climb the "Triple Cracks". This seemed like the physical crux of the route. Stance belay just above the obvious alcove. The rock below the alcove is somewhat loose, there is a thin crack just above the alcove that's solid.   P5(5.8, ~100'): Take the center of 3 cracks above the alcove. The left one looks like a wide lieback, and the right one is a splitter (but grainy) thin crack. The one in the middle takes the path of least resistance. After ~50', head left up a couple of rampy lieback sections (not the splitter hand crack directly above). Belay at a large ledge below a right-facing corner.   P6(5.10b, ~120'): Climb the crux dihedral. Stiff off the bat, then eases up. Below the smaller summit block, head left up an offwidth/chimney/stem with a large fixed cam in it. Belay at large ledge.   P7(5.7, ~50'): Head up/right through a small notch, then follow the right-slanting crack system on a slab below/around the larger summit block (the huge one that's obvious from the approach). Belay on another large ledge.   You're now on the summit ridge (~500'). The climbing along the ridge is inobvious, and is definitely not 3rd class, more like mixed 4th/5th class. Lots of gendarmes and large pillars to navigate. We ended up following the ridge proper for ~200', downclimbing to the right of the ridge, then heading straight up through blocky 5.6ish climbing to the summit plateau.

The vegetation has been removed, making for a more pleasant experience.  Climb up the finger crack systems on the right face of the corner.  This is a technically challenging and interesting section that can be made easier towards the top by chimneying in the corner.  Once safely established on the ledge, sink two pieces before making your move on the heady crux.  After all, you don't want to break your ankles.  Once in the midst of the crux, you're ankles are in jeopardy, so have your TCUs handy (my ankles are grateful).  Lieback, barndoor on a sloper up to a stance and reach for a jam.  You're practically done, so hike through the remainder of the crack to the anchors above the bigger ledge.  Don't despair if your head won't let you attempt the crux, you can lead up the corner and try the safer top-rope alternative.  This route is best climbed in groups of three.

The 1st pitch is about 75% chimneying, and not many chimneys are too enjoyable, so plan on blood and frustration.  After the chimney opens up, you can attain the belay ledge, right above the chockstone, by climbing very easy ladder-like ledges.    The 2nd pitch has no chimneying, but it does have a slightly overhanging section that seemed to climb more at 5.8 than 5.7.  It climbs up and left of the main crack system attaining a gritty but easy slab that you traverse across for the finish.    Once you reach the main sandy ledge, the exit is up and west.  Continue west and down, until you pass Hand Jive, and then Crack in the Woods.    Enjoy and bring the band-aids.

P2:  From the top of the chockstone belay, instead of heading left as for the Great Chockstone, head straight up then right past some awkward undercling corner moves (5.8 crux).  Climb up to the slanting ledge, then head left to a short crack that gains a nice belay stance at a slung boulder.  This pitch can be broken into two if rope drag is a bummer. P3:  Up the slanting, low angle but awkward corner.  Belay at a multi stalked scrub oak.  5.7. P4:  Originally, I think the climb went straight up the cruddy gully, or, across the top of the Crescent Crack Buttress face (no pro, very shallow ledge catwalk, 5.7ish).  But, you can head up and right, placing pro in the undercling crack for a short distance, then face climb to the last two bolts on the Final Link, which makes a great finish to this fun route.  Full value old school classic!

route_description: This is the large off width crack, to the left a little and up from Kutcorner. Using a 70M rope, we used the anchors on top of Hand Jive to toprope this climb. This crack looked easy on rappel but climbing it was a whole different matter. We didn't climb Kutcorner, but started from the very bottom and climbed this weird chimney to the left, up to the Kutcorner chains. Once you are up there it is obvious why the Falcon Wasatch Guide labels this as a 5.9 A0 or 5.11. From the chains you'd have to make the thinnest little friction moves to get to the crack. We both took the rope swing. A bolt has been placed above the chains to make the aid swing but because it is straight up, swinging from the bolt might be difficult.

route_description: This route was probably named this scary name because it was first climbed back when large protection was unavailable. With modern big gear one could sew it up if the climbing gear budget was big enough.  The large OW is visible from the schoolroom area and once at the base, you can really see how big it really is.  My guess is that you will be frustratingly close to squeezing into the chimney.  Close but no cigar.  Right side in, or left side in...  that is always debatable.  And I have had multiple climbing partners tell me that I do routes the "wrong way" 75% of the time.

route_description: This route is fun, and goes to a cool summit on a very cool looking spire. The approach is very short.  The climbing is relatively moderate, and it's sort of an easy tick for a desert spire.  It's a good one.  The route goes up cracks facing the road via free and aid climbing, until you get to a bolt ladder to the top.  I free climbed to 5.9, but you could free climb 5.10 if you wanted to.

When we did the climb, there was a drilled hole for a piton (which was missing)and that was the aid move.  We inserted a piton in the hole (and left it ), free climbing past it (At 5.9), and went to the summit.  It's a summit, an easy tick, and fun enough.  There is a route on the Right Teste, for you can see a rap anchor directly across while you are climbing the Left one.

Climb the crack using horns, jugs, knobs, some jams and stems, and at least one awkward left-stepping face move to a ledge with 3 bolts 10' below the summit.  The majority of the route goes at pretty decent 8, but be prepared for some slightly harder moves - the sandstone has eroded a bit and the climb is getting harder.  Belay from here - there's plenty of room for several people on the ledge.  Scramble up easy 4th class rock with some foot pockets to the summit (a piton on top and on an intermediate ledge assist in protecting this scramble) for an excellent view of the Garden of Eden.  Rap (do not lower) the route from the three-bolt anchor on the ledge.

route_description: What an incredible route!!  Lightning Bolt Cracks is one of the undisputed must-do ultra-classic desert towers and would be worth doing for the summit alone even if the climbing was total crap.  The position rivals the final pitch of the Naked Edge.  The route can be done in 3 or 4 pitches--many different belays are possible.  The various guidebooks (with the exception of Rock Climbing Utah) all have strangely inaccurate route descriptions.  P1-start on the right side of the east face in the beautiful splitter crack (fingers to chimney).  The left crack is 5.11+ and also very pretty.  I thought the real crux of this pitch was not at the beginning (rated 5.11a), but the overhanging, somewhat difficult to protect moves into the awkward leaning slot (rated variously 5.9 or 5.10) above.  You can do like me and place a very small wire left of the slot, but beware, it shifted when I, ahem, tugged on it...  One can belay at the fixed slings, or traverse left at 5.9+ and make an akward belay with tricky placements in the flared slot--I recommend the former (back the slings up!)  P2-two options-thin 5.11 fingers widening to splitter off-hands over a roof on the right, or 5.9 flared chimney widening to off-fists over a roof on the left.  I took the left, which is rated 5.10, although fairly burly by Creek 5.10 standards.  Have a #4 friend ready for the roof (I placed a tight #4 camalot which nearly became stuck).  One can belay above the roof (medium-large friends and/or more fixed delectables), or continue up and left (5.10-) in the acute corner to a spectacular belay just under the bombay chimney/roof.  P3-An unnerving spectacle: turn the huge roof (amazingly, only 5.10) into good hand jams; follow the cracks through progressively worse rock to the base of the final chimney.  If you are a big fella like me, belay here (small cams needed) and make your thinsome partner lead the final narrow sandy 5.9 squeeze.  Enjoy one of the best views of your life, then rappel.

Trample (as lightly as possible) up from the trail to the base. Start with #1 Camalot size until it pinches down slightly (#2 Friend), grunt (or panic depending on your style) through the thinness to a nice ledge on the left.  Continue up the widening (starts #2 Camalot size, ends #3 Camalot size) crack to the anchors on the right.  If your hands are small this will probably be a cruise.

parent_url: /v/top-of-the-world-overlook/105717230 
route_description: I don't know if it lives up to its moniker, but it is a very cool climb nonetheless.  One needs to do two double-rope raps to access the climb.  From the Top of the World Overlook, walk about 15 yards to the left (east).  Here you'll discover a deep cleft in the rock that goes from the edge way back and way down into the depths of the cliff.  This is the chimney you'll climb out on pitch 3, assuming all else goes well.  Step or jump over this hole and rap from a squat but sturdy juniper that is about 10 feet from the cliff face.  Standing at the edge of the cliff from the adjacent dihedral wall (the chimney forms the back of the dihedral), you can peer over and identify most of the climbing:  A small ledge below a bomb bay chimney, and a twin crack system that leads up the wall to a second ledge.  Rap down into the void 150' to a double bolt anchor, then one more double-rope rap will put you at the start of the climb.  P1:  Jam and stem the tricky chimney until it suddenly flares wide (bigger than fists).  Tackling this straight on would be quite difficult, but with some ingenuity you'll discover the really *cool* 10a way to do it.  Continue up on splitter, thin jams until you can trend off to the left on a leaning ramp.  Follow this to a ledge system and foot traverse back right to the center of the face.  Belay in a wide crack (#3 Camalot helpful for this belay).  A short pitch.  P2:  Continue up the nice crack system with a few chockstones up higher to the bolted belay.  5.9.  P3:  Climb up the chimney at 5....?  Perhaps there should be a new grading system.  CH 1-5?  Where CH 1 is a downright enjoyabale and easy chimney (say the upper pitches of the Priest), CH 2 is a little harder but the enjoyment factor is still high (say, Epinephrine), CH 3 - you start to wonder how much you're enjoying it, CH 4 is utterly miserable and only enjoyable, if at all, in retrospect, and CH 5 would describe anything that you're still stuck in and awaiting a rescue team.  If this were the case, this chimney would check in somewhere around CH 3.  In any case, there is pro for the half, then you have to "run" it out 75' to the top - fortunately you'll be able to see your goal above you for most of the time: daylight and 4-Wheelers with cold beer peering down at you and heckling.  Climb this chimney either at the very edge(exposed, less secure, but perhaps easier), or deep inside (secure but perhaps more awkward).  This is a good, memorable climb, worth the tedious approach.

route_description: If you are as fortunate as I was, this route begins at Lumpy Ridge near Estes Park, Colorado. Here, you can bury a nice granite sample in the rope at the bottom of your partner's pack, which can be hauled up to the base of The Priest the following weekend.  P1: This is the most serious and rewarding pitch on the route. Squirm your way up the fatter-than-fat dihedral. The amount of squeezing you can do is inversely proportional to your size. The crux has a 1/4" bolt nearby, which in even Wingate sandstone, should inspire confidence—right?  Find your own way through the crux, after which you can get a rest on a small ledge and clip drilled angle that will be in the back of your mind for the next thirty or forty feet of 5.9.  After this, you will occasionally get pro by slinging chock stones in the crack and/or placing stoppers between them.  As you near the end of this pitch, you will be able to chimney inside the crack. Belay just behind a large boulder wedged in the chimney.  You can build an anchor by threading a large stopper in between the boulder and the chimney and sticking a #3 Camalot near your feet.  Don't belay at the rap anchors 20' behind you or you will have hell to pay for rope drag.  After grunting up this pitch, I was rewarded with the following high-pitched whines from my second that made it all worthwhile: "I hate this! This sucks! I can't get in the crack!  Take!!!" If I could have recorded all this...  Maybe add a camcorder to the gear list. 5.9, really...  P2: This is the most fun pitch on the route. You'll see. I think it went around 5.7.  You basically chimney the whole thing. There is a fixed pin on this pitch.  Towards the top, you can get a couple of cams. It ends on a nice ledge with two of those nice and fat Metolius rap anchors.  P3: This pitch is either about 5.7 A0 or 5.11-.  Head up and right from the belay. There are some fixed pro and cam placements as you do the first part of this pitch. You get a nice body stem to access the arete/face that takes you upward toward the summit.  The face/arete (11- or A0) is basically a bolt ladder where some bolts are relics and others are decent-looking. This accesses a ledge, which you traverse to the left before gaining the belay. You are totally uncool to your second if you don't put a #2 Camalot in the crack at the back of this ledge after doing the bolt ladder.  P4: This is a relatively short dihedral crack system that goes at 5.8.  This nice little pitch puts you on the summit.  Summit - while on the summit, read the summit register notebook COVER to COVER and be sure to view the creative artwork within its bindings.  You will thank me.

The correct dihedral is a stellar looking handcrack with no visible fixed anchors from the base.  Be careful to find washes to reach the base-there is a lot of crypto soil and not much of a trail.  Pitch 1 - climb fingers and hands through some bulges to a big bulge just before the anchor.  There are some fixed pins at a ledge halfway up the pitch.  5.10 or awkward C1, 100'  Pitch 2 - climb a varied crack over a bulge, move left one crack system, and head over a bulge to a 5.7 squeeze chimney.  5.11 or C1.  I placed everything from a blue alien to a 5 camalot on this pitch.  130 feet, belay between the heads of the gossips.  The anchor is about 30 feet to the right of the pitch, but a good directional can be set up with large cams.  Pitch 3 - climb a sandy poorly protected slab 5.7 to the big chimney.  Tunnel in and climb unprotected to the top 5.5  70 feet, a few medium cams is all you get.  A single rope rap gets you to the shoulder.

To truly summit you have to traverse across the summit ridge and then back for the rappels. P1 = Climb the slab using friction and climber-made moki steps. These steps are the result of years of banging pins into drilled holes and then extracting them on that ascent... not a good idea for the rock. It has now been bolted so that this is no longer  needed. It is very soft. At the bulge there are a couple of sketchy C1 moves that might also go a 5.11. A fall would not be far, but would leave a nasty mark as you would slab-out. Continue on to the ledge. This is a 55 meter pitch P2 = traverse in a hand size crack (C1) around to the east face of the tower and a nice ledge.... a 20 meter pitch. P3 = the Ewetopian Crack. Follow a beautiful thin crack up the face just left of the corner. I found good placements the whole way, but I often top-stepped to get them. This is one of the finest aid pitches in Arches. Its C2 and about 45 meters in length. P4 = Follow a finger and hand size crack to the bulge, then move through the bulge on a pin and some thin wires. This is strenuous and the rock deteriorates a bit. A fall would be ugly because of the slab. If you have a wide, piece, it will help you transition into a few free moves. At the top use a pin, and edge, and maybe some manky gear, to pull onto the summit ridge. THis pitch is 20 meters long and C2+/5.10-. P5 = walk across the ridge to the summit knob. You can feed a cordolette through the holes to protect you on the 5.4 move onto the summit. Reverse it to the rappel anchors. This pitch is 30 meters. Rap the route on 1/2 bolts and brown chain placed by the Arches Task Force in March of 2007. Please try not to add webbing to the route as it is visible from the highway.

route_description: Get to the North Face of Bubo Tower from Balanced Rock as described on the "Rock Page."  There is one feature on this face... a yawning chimney that splits it.    Climb up a soft slab for perhaps 10-20 feet, I don't recall exactly how high... and enter the chimney.    I slowly picked my way up this, first more or less squeezing, then with my back on one side and feet on the other, then finally in a near-splits, which was slow-going.  Much to my surprise, my partner followed at great speed as he got to the top- with hands on one side and feet on the other- walking up that way.  Of course, placing gear like this would be no fun.  The route was originally 3 pitches.  Given the little amount of gear and shortness of the climb, doing it in a single pitch as we did seemed much better.    Rap from anchors on the top via 2 ropes (50M will do). A single 70M might get you down. The condition of the webbing on the anchors up top is unknown. It was total crap when I did the climb and I replaced them, but that has been 7 years of desert sun and wind atop a tower.    As always when doing towers, take some new red/brown webbing just in case.

route_description: This route climbs the South Gossip via a crack system on the right side of the west face. Like many of the routes in Arches, the start is soft, sandy, and spooky. Unlike many of the routes in Arches, the rock on the rest of this climb is mostly excellent and almost feels like wingate in places.  Pitch 1  Climb through the soft rock either in a right facing corner or to the right of the corner. Youre aiming for a wide crack which is followed to a comfortable belay ledge. Belay from a fixed anchor. A variation climbs the thin crack to the right at 5.11d to the same belay. 5.11 or 5.10, C1  (It may even be 5.9 but the start is hard to rate)   Pitch 2  Step right around a pillar and follow a beautiful crack up an acute dihedral to the base of the summit block. Belay from a fixed anchor on a ledge. 5.11 or 5.9, C1  Pitch 3 - A couple interesting free moves access a bolt ladder which leads to the top. C1  Rappel the Route

route_description: P1 original 5.6 C2, 25m. Between the huge boulder leaning against the cliff to your right, and the largish block on your left make a couple of easier free moves onto the ledge atop the left block placing you below the thin splitter crack with the obvious pin scars. A yellow master cam can protect the opening moves, and a #5 or #6 BD Camalot can protect the move onto the ledge if you're so inclined.  From the ledge follow the splitter crack into the right-facing corner above and then over the small roof above the corner. HB/DMM Alloy Offset nuts work like a dream in the pin scars. Once above the roof microcams mixed with nuts are the ticket (again, offsets work well) until you reach the belay anchor.  P1 variation 5.4 C1 or 5.10, 25m. Stem and climb up onto the large boulder on the right. Take the crack that goes up from the right side of the boulder. This starts as .75 BD and eventually widens to 4 inches. There is a bit of looseness just before the ledge so be careful.   P2 C2, 25m. From the belay anchor step left and follow the obvious scars up the shallow, left-facing corner. Cams mixed with nuts work well; A four-inch cam is useful a bit below the obvious bulge above, but the cam placement can't be seen from below.  The bulge to the right of the triangular roof responds well to small nuts (offsets and Wild Country Superlight Rocks seem to be the ticket), and from there it's a mix of nuts and cams to the belay anchor.  P3 C2, 30m. Head up the thin crack using small nuts for twenty feet or so, then a few larger nuts. The last 15 feet or so below the optional belay chains you'll be very happy to have doubles in red through blue tricams for use in the blown out pin scars. Without the tricams the placements will be somewhat nerve-wracking.  Note that if you are so inclined, you could stretch P2 to the optional belay anchor; it'd probably help a bit with rope drag.  From the optional belay anchor, head left and up to a fixed pin (a blue tricam is useful in a blown out scar before the pin). The first of two bolts is up and left from the pin. It's possible to do the required pendulum to the corner to the left from the first bolt, but it's a bit dicey so do yourself a favor and wait until the second bolt.  Once in the corner purple-C4-size cams work well as the right-leaning crack gradually widens to green C4 size, and then red C4 size as it becomes horizontal for four or five feet. More red C4-size cams to get over the bulge and then up the lower-angled crack to the belay anchor (a last purple C4 is nice, and a few easy free/french free moves to the chains are possible if you're impatient).  P4 C3, 30m. From the anchors step up and slightly right using a bolt to a stance, and some dicey placements (a tenuous-looking pink tricam with an even more tenuous-looking nut above works) lead to a narrow ledge atop a flake, below a sketchy-looking wedge bolt with most of the threads visible. If you aren't abnormally tall, a large Ibis hook placement on the ledge directly below the bolt allows you to step up and reach the bolt.  From the bolt a small cam (yellow offset Mastercam or red alien) under the left of the roof leads to some offset nut placements up the left-facing corner. At the top of the corner under the roof are two bolts followed by a drilled angle. The moves out from under the roof onto the face to the right are strenuous, and figuring out how to make use of the boxed-out scars takes a bit of head-scratching (hint: orange Mastercam).  Once on the face traverse slightly up and mostly right using fixed pins to a bolt below the belay anchor. Various scary combinations of placements and moves are possible, but it will take some commitment,  P5 5.3 C2. 25m From the belay head up and right using two bolts with hangers and a hangerless stud between to a thin left-leaning crack. A few not-quite-confidence-inspiring nut placements in pin scars lead to a fixed pin, and from thence it's up and a bit right along the crack with nuts and microcams to a short, tight-hands-sized horizontal.   From the horizontal it's up and right along a bolt ladder with two fixed pins. When the ladder ends a few easy free moves using boxed-out pin scars lead to the belay anchors.  P6 3rd class C0. 20m. Walk counter-clockwise around the shoulder to the lowest point on the cap rock and follow a two bolt ladder up to the summit. A little more scrambling leads to the true summit.

parent_url: /v/bullwinkle-tower/105717235 
route_description: As the title says, West Chimney.  When you get to the tower, you can walk around the main formation and look for the easiest looking chimney, if your sense of direction isn't up to par.  The climb starts with an easy slab, up over a slightly tougher bulge, before you get to the crack below the chimney.  (Approach the route and climb the bulge from the left.)  Climb the crack, which takes good pro, and has the probable crux of the route, up to the chimney proper.  You can get a last piece of gear in at the base of the chimney, but the chimney is basically unprotectable.  However, it isn't really possible to fall out of the chimney and it is much, much easier than it may look to the beginning desert climber.  Climb the fun, easy chimney to the top, there are slings on the north summit.    Descent:  A one rope rappel is straightforward if you rappel directly west of the summit anchor, however, if your second does not reach the top and you are forced to rappel back into the chimney in order to retrieve gear, be very, very careful with the force you are putting on a sketchy looking cooler sized boulder on the top.  Because of this, it is definitely not a good idea to top rope this tower from the rappel anchors.  But you could easily set up an anchor at the actual top of the chimney itself.  I find it hilarious to see the crowds (literally) lining up in bunches at the base of Owl Rock only a few hundred yards away.  This very well could be the easiest way to climb technical rock to the top of a tower on the Colorado Plateau.  It is short, sweet, easy, and right next to the road.

parent_name: The Titan 
parent_url: /v/the-titan/105717006 
route_description: A certified desert classic and a visionary first ascent in its day.  Not nearly as loose as rumored, but do expect large doses of mank.  Only a couple sections require tricky aid but loads of ancient, often hilarious, fixed gear keep the excitement level high.  The aid is mostly clean but we did have to place about 7 or so pins.Most of the anchors have at least one good bolt.  There are a couple strategies for climbing this route.  Many guides call this route grade IV but only a very fast party will be able to do the route in a day.  In the end it took us about 14 hours of climbing spread over 2 days to summit.  The most likely option is to climb the first 5-1/2 pitches on the first day, fix 3 ropes down the descent route, then jug to the highpoint and finish off the route the next day.  The jugging on the descent route is miserable so if you're pretty fast (or you have the long days of late-spring) then try to do it in a day.  Approach: follow the obvious trail to the Titan, circumnavigating the tower around to the NE side.  The approach takes a little over an hour with full aid climbing regalia.  The route starts in the crack system about 30 feet to the left of the obvious descent gully.  P1- aid up the crack system, passing a false belay, to a belay about 140 feet off the deck (C1).  P2- continue up the crack system into a flaring groove, 75 feet (A2).   P3- continue up the obvious line to a ledge at the base of the Finger, 75 feet (A2).  P4- traverse the ledge around the corner (5.6) to an ancient bolt.  Aid the roof (A2, tricky) and continue to a belay on the other side of the Finger, 60 feet.  If you're lucky the pin stack we placed and couldn't clean will still be there.  P5- scramble up to a drilled pin, then continue up the strenuous flare (C1 or 5.10).  At the top of the flare, 5.8 groveling (free crux) is required to reach the belay, 80 feet.   P6- traverse around the left side of "The Duck".  On the other side of the duck is the anchor for the descent route (3 double rope rappels to the base).  continue up the wide crack system (5.8) to a large ledge (bivy site) and belay, 100 feet.  P7- traverse right around the arete to a seam.  Aid the seam (A2) back up to the crest of the arete.  Mixed free (5.7-5.8) and aid (C2) past questionable fixed gear leads to an exposed stance on the arete, 80 feet.   P8- Mixed free (5.7-5.8) and aid (C2, very long reaches, trickery necessary) past more museum relics to a wide crack.  Continue up the crack, over a roof in the caprock (wild exposure), and mantle up to the belay, 120 feet.  P9- 4th class to the summit  Descent- rappel from the top of P8 to top of P7.  Rappel from top of P7 to the anchor next to The Duck on P6.  Three rappels down the gully to the base.  You can also save yourself the trouble of walking all the way back around the Titan by making 2 double rope rappels to the west down the cliff near the base.

route_description: The Direct North Ridge combines the North Ridge from the notch with an extra 800 feet of fun climbing.  Although loose in spots and somewhat lichen covered, the route offers those looking for a longer, harder day than the North Ridge  good solid 5.9+ climbing.  It will obviously be faster to simulclimb, my partner and I did this and completed the entire route in 6.5 hours, but the belays for each pitch take good gear and have decent stances.    Roughly the first 3 pitches are the hardest. 1: Climb up easy terrain off a big ledge about 150 feet above the base of the toe to a small tree. 2: Continue up through an awkward 5.8 slot (harder with backpacks) to a face and then to a nice ledge. Small crimps inside the slot for the left hand are useful and make sure to step out on the face with your feet. 3: Follow a striking lie back crack on your left for quite a ways. This is 5.9+ and sustained.  Once you pull over a small roof there will be another ledge to set up a belay.    From here veer up and right, following the path of least resistance.  The rock at times is loose and almost always covered in crumbly black lichen. It is mostly easy 5th class with an occasional 5.6 move. There is, about 5 pitches up, a short slab traverse that takes you even further to the right.  Once you do this, the Notch ridge will come into view and once reached it will connect you with the Upper North Ridge. It takes longer than you think, but keep on trucking.    For the Upper North Ridge look at Max Tepfer's description on this page. To add to it though, begin by staying on the left (east) side of the ridge.  Then follow an easy ramp up to the ridge.  Move up left over a bulge (5.6) and then on to an exposed section on the west side of the ridge.  From here follow the ridge to the super cool 5.5 slab split by an amazing crack and then to the Gendarme--about 8 or 9 pitches from the Notch.  The Gendarme can be done in two pitches; 1: a 5.8 lie back and 2: a 5.9+ off-width, or you can link the pitches easily with a 60m rope (use runners to  prevent rope drag) which is what my partner and I did.  The Gendarme is almost always in the shade and can be very cold or even icy.

route_description: This is an absolute classic route, one of the 50, moderate, with excellent climbing, exposure, and adventure.  It is not to be underestimated though, as it is also very remote and requires a certain amount of detailed planning and luck with the weather.  It has been climbed in a day, but most parties do it in two nights and 3 days.  Day one is to get there, arrange the shuttle and hike to the propeller cairn or wooded knoll, day two for the climb, and beginning of the descent to the forested knoll above Chilliwack-Slesse FSR, and part of day 3 for the hammer down the trail and back to the car.  There is an optional bivouac ledge, big enough for several people and unroped walking with a permanent(?) snow field at the top of pitch 18 (approximate).  There is an excellent topo available on naclassics.com (edit note: this site is no longer active, here's an alternate provided by J.Roatch: lamountaineers.org/NAC/browser..., and Kevin McLane's Alpine Select covers all of the bases.  I will provide only a brief description of the climbing here, along with access information.  The ramp from the Bypass glacier avoids the first 6 or so pitches of the NE Buttress Direct (5.10C) From the top of the Bypass ramp, the climb generally follows the crest moving back and forth, and going around a prominent gendarme.  Many variations are possible.  It is a mix of 4th class and moderate (5.7-5.8) 5th class climbing At approximately pitch 14, there is a 5.10A variation that stays on the crest.  The actual route is right of the crest after a short traverse, in a prominent left facing dihedral.  It follows this up for 3-4 pitches to the Bivvy ledge.  We did the 10A variation, following slings close to the crest.  It is not well traveled and the climbing was less than enjoyable, unless you like long runouts on gear placed in mossy cracks! The climbing out of the bivvy is 4th class for about 3-4 pitches.   The last 6 pitches (above the large bivouac) were the best climbing.  In all, we simul-climbed about half of the route. From the propeller cairn, to the summit, took us 12 hours.  We had perfect weather the whole day and simul climbed about half of the route.  Water was available from several streams on the approach, runoff on the glacier bedrock, and again at the snowfield on the bivouac ledge.  We each carried two liters. Kevin McLane's guide describes the glacier crossings as having a degree of difficulty out of proportion to the climbing above, and we were fortunate that they had slid.  Crossing the glaciers would have added several hours to our time.  Descent:  There are a couple of options described in the guides, but by far the easiest one is to descend to the Chilliwack-Slesse FSR parking lot, located 8KM from the main road.  From the summit, at the top of the climb is a small bowl.  Traverse to the far side of the bowl and look for cairns dropping down to the first rappel.  The way is not always obvious, but cairns are present, so keep an eye out.  Make several rappels, interspersed with rightward traverses until you are above the col, and below the finish of the climb.  One last rappel allows access to the faint trail heading southwest towards a prominent ridge that descends very steeply to the forested knoll.  We arrived here about 10 PM, 4 hours after summiting and by headlamp.  The trail from here descends quickly(read: very steep) but is more obvious as you get lower.  Eventually, you will reach the old road bed, by a memorial, and from there it is an easy 3KM walk to the parking lot.  Water from seeps and springs was available here.  Except for a couple of folks hiking up to the Memorial, we did not see anyone else for 2 days.

Start a few feet left of the left nose of the buttress, and follow two or three pitches of steep 5.6 climbing on generally excellent rock to the top of the Big Step.  More moderate scrambling works up the ridge to another low angle section.    Hike easily along the ridge, mindful of loose rock, until the dark gray bands of the Black Towers are reached.  At this point locate a prominent ledge system and traverse left several hundred feet, eventually wroking up & left to the next higher ledge system, and traversing another several hundred feet (snow may be encountered depending on conditions).  Continue the west-ward traverse until below a pair of similar-sized, conical towers.    A gully splits these towers, and another gully goes around the right-most tower on the right side.  Follow this, right-most gully for a couple pitches on relatively solid limestone at low 5th class to regain the crest of the ridge.  Occasionally the upper half of this gully is filled with snow.  Don the appropriate snow gear and follow the corniced ridge to the summit, mindful of crevasses and soft cornices.

route_description: This face looks scary from the parking lot so don't linger looking at it. Doing the climb in a day is a long day but I'd recommend this. If you take bivy gear it will slow you down and it is best to spend as little time as possible on the lower part of this face as it is very exposed to rockfall.  Getting to the Angel Glacier is non-trivial and we checked it out the day before. From the parking lot, cross the stream and head up an obvious moraine that heads toward the cliff right of (and below) the Angel Glacier and Icefall. We found a low 5th class route left of a waterfall with one bolt and a few rap anchors on it. This is fairly easy to find - during the day!  Above here we wandered up and right on easy scrambling terrain, crossing to the right side of the stream that forms the waterfall.  Do not traverse left here or you could be killed by a falling ice block from the Angel Icefall. Eventually you reach some nice bivy sites at the edge of the Angel Glacier. If you know the route, you can get to this point in only about 1.5 hours from the car (even roping up for the crux cliff).  Rope up and cross the Angel Glacier. Above the left side of the Angel Glacier in the middle of the North Face locate a prominent pillar. This is the crux rock section of the route and what you want to shoot for. Below this the line depends on where you can cross the 'scrund. This section is mostly easy scrambling with a lot of loose rock. It's extremely exposed to rockfall so whatever you do, don't linger.  After crossing a prominent snow band about 1/3 of the way up the face, climb a pitch up a V-slot, then traverse right to the toe of the crux buttress. Three to four excellent short pitches lead up this buttress at about 5.7 in difficulty on stellar quartzite (some of the best rock I've encountered in the Canadian Rockies). It is great when you reach this section because it is spectacular and also the danger of rockfall is much less from this point on.  Above the crux buttress the difficulties ease and you can follow a rock rib on the left or snowy gully on the right depending on conditions. We followed the rock rib and this became quite difficult near the top where there was a short vertical wall dripping with water with a piton for pro. It may be easier to move right here and climb some snow or ice. It was extremely dry on the route when we did it and we were able to climb rock pretty much from the bergscrund all the way to this point (except for crossing a few snowfields). However I believe this is quite unusual.  At this point you reach the summit snowfield, which can vary from a foot of mush (when we did it, probably a bad idea) to ice.  It averages about 45 degrees, with some sections steeper.  Somehow the knowledge that a 2000 foot cliff underlies this simple snowfield makes it much more terrifying.  I recommend avoiding the shale bands just below the summit. They look easy but there will be absolutely no pro (so I hear). Traverse left to avoid the shale. Master the cornice (small for us) to top out very close to the summit.

route_description: The Kain Route is the original way up Mount Robson.  There once was a huge serac that loomed over part of the face, but glacial wasting has now removed the threat.  Currently, this is probably the safest way to climb Robson.   Remote climbing with low odds for success given the weather, snow conditions and logistics. Still once you get your shot, moderate to steep snow and ice climbing up the Kain Face and then moderate climbing up snow and ice faces and around gargoyles of ice leads to a large summit with a small summit bump.   If you think getting up is tough, getting down can be a job once the Kain Face softens and becomes very hazardous to downclimb. Be prepared to sit it out till the sun goes down and the freeze comes to stabilize the face. Do not underestimate the decent.   It is all worth it!

route_description: This climb is one of the best I have ever done!  It follows a continuous crack system for almost 900 feet and has everything from fingers to offwidth.  The following description is as my partner and I climbed it which was in six long pitches with a 60m rope.  Done this way we thought that every pitch was in the 5.10 range.  Bring two ropes to rap off (we had a tag line) and some warm clothes since you'll be in the shade for most of the climb.    P1:  Climb up a steep right facing dihedral with two cracks and pull through a slight overhang on the left.  Continue up an obvious crack bypassing the first anchor.  The crack gradually widens to an offwidth as the wall gets steeper.  Work your way up the solid 5.10 OW and pull onto lower angle rock to another anchor.  I thought this pitch felt about 5.10c.  P2:  Continue up the crack for about 10' until you get to another crack that angles slightly up and right.  Hand traverse right until the crack starts heading straight up again and follow it past an anchor into a perfect 2" crack.  Layback to the right off a wide crack and into a dihedral and belay at the anchor.  (Note: I was about 5' short of the anchor so we had to simul-climb to reach it).  P3:  Continue up the dihedral till you get to another overhang.  Power through a crack near the left side of the overhang and then traverse back right to gain another crack that continues up and belays about 20' below the crux roof.  This pitch is probably hard 10.  P4:  The crux of this pitch and the whole climb is obvious.  Climb up 20' until your beneath a large corner roof.  Plug a couple pieces at the lip and fire it, I didn't think this was to hard, just don't hang out or fiddle with gear until your back on your feet.  Climb past an anchor and up another overhanging bulge to a good belay stance.  P5:  Follow the cracks up and slightly right in a left facing dihedral from what I can recall.  The crack will gradually go back left following a large flake until you get to a stance beneath a splitter wide-hands/fist crack.  P6:  This pitch is the icing on the cake.  Jam the steep hand and fist crack for about 100' until the crack splits left and right.  If your spent you might want to consider going left at about 5.8 but it would be a shame to miss the crack heading right.  Hand traverse right with great exposure  and into a perfect hand crack that heads up and back left.  As the crack comes to an end place one last piece and pull a few hard face moves to top out.  This pitch is long but a 60m rope will just make it.  At this point you can rap back down the way you came up or jump onto one of the other routes nearby if you want to go to the summit.

route_description: This is another good climb that's close to camp for those days when the weathers not so good.  This route is also a classic so you might have to wait in line.  P1:  Climb up flakes to a small corner roof, step left to another crack and continue up a short chimney to a belay on top of a pillar. (5.9) (Or just jam straight up the roof with perfect hands at 5.10)  P2:  This pitch is classic.  Follow a finger and hand crack out left from above the belay to an alcove.  Climb up through the alcove jamming the outstanding crack up a steep face to a ledge and belay at a chain anchor. (5.10-) (the first two pitches can be combined)  P3:  Climb some corners and easy ground up and to the right to another anchor. (5.4)  P4:  Step right from the anchor behind a flake and climb up a nice corner to a roof.  Traverse out right under the roof to another corner and pull a second roof to a belay ledge on the left with chains. (5.9)  P5:  Climb some cracks on the face to the right and gain a corner which leads to another ledge with chains. (5.8)  P6:  Climb up a steep corner and then scramble left around the arete.  Continue up a face to the ridge crest and belay. (5.7)

route_description: This is a fun route on really good quality rock and all the pitches are rated 5.10 according to the book with the crux coming on the 4th pitch.  P1:  Start about 10' to the left of a large left facing dihedral and follow finger cracks up the face.  Two overhangs are encountered on this pitch which are bypassed by climbing left around the first one and right around the second.  Belay just above the second overhang at a small stance.  P2:  Follow cracks and face climbing to a steeper upper wall and belay.  P3:  Continue climbing the face heading up and right to a chimney, struggle up the chimney and belay on top at a two bolt anchor.  (It is also possible to avoid the chimney by traversing to the right and climbing a hand crack to the same stance).  P4:  Step right and climb up a steep crack corner to perfect hands through a roof.  Pull the roof and belay in a crack to the left.   P5:  Climb straight up awkward finger to fist sized cracks to the top of the ridge.

route_description: P1:Head up easy but slightly spooky flakes to a short, steep handcrack. Pull through this(technical crux) to the base of the obvious large roof and a great rest. Lieback out through the roof with good, but spread-out feet, saving juice for the awkard and strenous lip encounter.  Pull over the lip on perfect hands and bad/high feet and then cruise up the easy but excellent hand crack. Walk over the top of the flake and down to a ledge with a two bolt anchor.  Alt. and probably better P2, as provided by Kedron:   As an alternate second pitch, I went straight up an off-fingers (BD .75) crack a few feet to the left of the arete which starts ~30 feet above the McTech roof until it tapered off. Then around the arete into the top of energy crisis and up to the chains at the top of the second pitch of McTech. This seemed similar difficulty to the first pitch, and not particularly scary.  Bad P2:  "P2" Walk to the flake you climbed over on the first pitch and head directly up the crack through some easy OW to a crumbly lieback flake that feels insecure but is relatively easy. Climb this until the obvious finger crack presents itself. Climb the fingercrack on exfoliating feet and then traverse with no pro about 20 feet left(10-, PG13) to a loose gully-type feature. Mountaineer this rubble-choked POS  until you reach a large sloping black ledge(5.6, R/X). Belay your partner up, then traverse down and right to a two bolt anchor and continue to the top on the McTech Arete Route.  I think the P2 could be made safer and more enjoyable by traversing farther right off the belay ledge to the next, or by finding a face traverse below the finger crack. As it stands in my description, P2 is a bomb pitch with the potential for large falls and pulling blocks onto your belayer and parties below.

route_description: The best rock climb in the world? Most routes to which this moniker is added may seem insignificant compared to the SE Face of Lotus Flower Tower. The route climbs perfect alpine granite for 18 pitches to an amazing summit.  The climb is all about uniformity. The first three pitches climb a well-defined left facing corner. The next five or six pitches climb a long chimney. Then, the fun starts. After a short left facing corner, the last ten pitches or so climb cracks and knobs on the exposed and narrowing face.    Pitch 1: Climb a left-facing corner to a fixed belay. 5.8  Pitch 2: Continue up this corner to a fixed belay 5.9  Pitch 3: Follow the corner until it's end and exit right, skirting below a large roof. This pitch is often wet, but when dry, the exit moves feel about 5.10a.  Pitch 4: Since you are on the face now, wander up the face to the base of a long chimney. 5.7  Pitches 5-9: Climb up the 5.7 chimney. The chimney is long but secure. It's possible and advisable to simul-climb this section, especially if you're doing the route in a day.   Pitch 10: Wander up and right to a large ledge. This ledge is big enough to park a school bus on, well, probably a short bus. 5.8 This ledge is an excellent bivy, as it's totally flat.   Pitch 11: Climb a big left facing corner, 5.9+, to an amazing small ledge at the very edge of the face.   Pitches 12-15: Follow parallel cracks up the face of the tower. Though you protect in the cracks, the preponderance of strange diorite knobs encourages face climbing. There are many ways to ascend this section. Just follow knobs to the base of an unmistakable roof. 5.9  Pitch 16: Climb past the obvious three-foot roof. This move is easily aided, making the route 5.10 C1. Otherwise, expect a 5.11- pull past the route. This move is much more difficult than any other move on the route. It is possible to traverse right and climb a splitter hand crack through the roof, but this may present its own set of problems. Sustained 5.9 cracks lead up to the belay.  Pitches 17 and 18: Gradually widening cracks lead to the summit. The last pitch contains some 5.8 offwidth climbing, but it's really not too bad.  Descent: Rap the route. The upper part of the route has fixed belay stations, so rapping is straightforward (just be careful about snagging your rope on the knobs). Once you reach the ledge, the rap route diverges from the climbing route and heads down the face. There is a serious epic potential here as the stations are tough to find on the big face.  Stay out of the chimney at all costs. I know. If you end up rapping back into the chimney, you're in for a long and slow descent as your rope gets hung up on every possible feature.

route_description: A Teton classic with great exposure, a short (by Teton standards) approach and simple descent.  Not to be missed!  The climb follows a beautiful crack/dihedral system just right of a huge arete.  The bulk of the climbing is stellar finger-crack climbing on good rock with airy belays and spectacular exposure.  Expect semihanging belays on most pitches.  The climb faces south, so it does benefit from some solar warming.  Pitch 1 - The guidebooks suggest two starts - either a direct 5.9 finger/handcrack or a traverse in from the right.  I've done both and the direct start is the way to go. Better crack, and way less rope drag.  After tackling the 40 feet of 5.9 jamming, work up an easy section of rock and find a belay stance (below the first overhang?) seem to recall a less-than-perfect anchor here - with a small nut being the best piece.  Pitch 2 - Awesome 5.8 climbing on beautiful, stellar rock.  Just keep chugging away straight up the obvious crack.  You'll pass a small overhang (to the right) on this pitch.  Great protection the whole way.  Belay on top of a big detached flake at a small stance.  Note: You can combine Pitch 1 and 2 above (provided you do the direct start) with a 60m rope - which will *just* make it.  Pitch 3 - The money pitch. Cranking 5.8 liebacking off the belay (slick feet) leads up to an AWESOME section of finger-crack climbing and stemming through a small overhang ending up at a sloping belay ledge below a giant roof.  Perfect rock.  Pitch 4 - Improbable but straightforward climbing to the right and up through the roof on great holds.  After clearing the roof, follow the crack system up and right to another sloping belay ledge beneath an attractive crack.  Pitch 5 - Two options here as well.  You can go right and have some easy 5th-class climbing, or straight up another great crack pitch finishing with a 5.9+ roof move.  Good pro makes this pitch recommended, even if the grade might be a little intimidating.  Belay on a huge ledge.  Pitch 6 - Face climb straight up until you can get into the big crack.  Once the crack ends traverse up and right to finish the climb.  I've comfortably done this route in about 7 1/2 hours car to car moving efficiently, but not racing by any means.

route_description: Begin by climbing up the right side of the Teton Glacier and then move back left to the base of the Grandstand.  This is a real glacier and contains some giant crevasses.  Ortenburger warns against climbing the right of two chimneys which begin the face left of the base of the Grandstand.  However I believe we may have started too far left because of this warning.  Crossing the bergschrund may be a problem, but was not during our ascent.  Ortenburger calls the start a chimney but we climbed a steep face with lots of ledges and rubble.  Then climb up and right a few ropelengths to the base of the Guano Chimney, which leads directly to the lower left part of the First Ledge.  The First Ledge is several hundred feet wide, but slopes at about 20-40 degrees and usually contains some snow.  We found no guano in the namesake chimney.  Follow the First Ledge up and right until it ends.  This is several pitches but mostly easy scrambling, and the main difficulty is snow, melting snow, or verglas.  If completely dry this traverse is 3rd-4th class.  We experienced melt water flowing over slabs and definitely stayed roped up for the lower section.  From the far right end of the First Ledge, climb up steeply to reach the Second Ledge.  This pitch and the Guano Chimney are rated 5.6 and form the cruxes of the lower part of the route.  Follow the Second Ledge right until it is easy to climb upward to the Third Ledge.  If looking for an easy escape, the easiest is to keep traversing the Second Ledge all the way to the Owen Spalding.  However by far the most classic line is to reach the Third Ledge and traverse up and right to the base of Pendulum Pitch.  The top section is the same as for the North Face Highlight Tour, see that description.  The pendulum pitch looks intimidating from below, this Photo may be helpful in recognizing the correct place to start upward off the 3rd ledge.

route_description: When you put your faith in God, He always makes sure to put you in the place you are supposed to be; that is the mantra I use for myself when I am climbing in the mountains. So, this describes for me how I felt when I was climbing the East Ride of the Grand Teton. Though it is only a grade III, the East Ridge is, according to the rangers at Jenny Lake, one of the longest routes to be climbed on the peak. This is most likely because it is one of the routes that you are actually climbing on soonest; that is closest to the trailhead from where you start hiking; not that the actual technical nature of the route is the longest by any means, when it is really pretty short, and most of the route is just a slog. Dont take that too lightly though; this route throws a lot at you over a great deal of varying terrain. When looking at available guides for climbing in the Tetons, it is clear that there are a multitude of variations that are possible on this route. So, this description will stick to the climb I did, and I am looking forward to seeing input that other people may add on the route as well. I started at the end of the terminal moraine of the Teton Glacier, turned the Molar Tooth via the Tricky Traverse, and skirted the Second Tower on the North side to reach the summit snow fields, finishing up near where the Upper Exum route would reach the summit. Basically, the easiest start to this route begins literally from the end of the terminal moraine of the Teton Glacier, where it butts up against the side of the mountain. In other words, follow the normal route that you would take to approach the Teton Glacier from Amphitheater Lake, and take a left from atop the highest point on the moraine, following its crest until you bump into the mountain. Most likely, there will be a series of cairns to follow once you reach the top of the terminal moraine. A series of bivy sites can also be found atop the terminal moraine once you get close to where the route begins.  To me it seems logical to break the route up into four different sections; the lower part of the ridge from the end of the terminal moraine to the Molar Tooth, turning the Molar Tooth, up to and around the Second Tower, and the upper snow fields leading to the exit for the summit block.  Lower Part of the Ridge  For the first section; once you reach the end of the terminal moraine, start climbing directly from its end through a short, but steep section that will give way directly to a series of tree covered ledges allowing access to gain upward progress on the eastern slopes of the mountain. Most of the climbing in this section is fairly easy; rather it would be more like scrambling rather than technical climbing. Most likely a rope will not be needed for this part of the climb other than for the very first part if you are not comfortable with how steep the first 50 feet or so of the climb are. Continue climbing up the broad, but easy slopes of the face of the mountain until you begin to bump into the Molar Tooth. You will know you are at this point because the climbing will suddenly begin to become much more technical in what is being presented to you. The Ortenburger/Jackson guide describes a bowl that you should be climbing into at this point, but a bowl was something that I could not distinguish. Rather, I had the feeling that the climbing was going to become significantly harder, and I started to traverse in a leftward manner (to the south); looking for a chimney/corner system that should be pretty easy to pick out. Dont bother messing around with trying to climb this chimney/corner system. The better thing to do is to keep traversing further around to the left until you reach a crest that is easily climbed to gain upward progress in order to reach a break in the ridge that is called the window.  Molar Tooth  From the window is where the Tricky Traverse begins; this traverse will allow you to bypass a descent/rappel into a snow filled gully that must be climbed up to and over a large chockstone. The traverse climbs some technical terrain that bypasses the chockstone, putting you into the notch above the chockstone, bypassing some snow and wet rock climbing into and back out of the gully. Somehow I began the Tricky Traverse in a way that seemed to be much too low, but that is how it goes in the mountains sometimes. However you do it, you will have to climb/traverse above the gully on a steep and exposed wall trying to gain ground above the chockstone to reach the notch. I began by traversing and then down climbing only to realize that I was much too low. Looking upwards; you may spy a few slings around a block, which clearly indicates the way you should be going. Getting back on route with where the topo said I was supposed to be, the climbing was much easier, but the rock was not so great either.  As I side note, I did this climb on the 40th anniversary of the 1969 Woodstock Festival. While driving to the Tetons, various news broadcasts were reminiscing about the PSA for how the brown acid was not so good.. That definitely struck a chord with me about some of the rock that I was forced to climb upon and over during parts of the Tricky Traverse, and also on higher parts of the mountain. I was a little nervous about the nature of what I had to climb up onto and stand upon in order to gain higher progress, but at least it stayed in place, and I did not take a big ride back down to the glacier. Once you have gained sufficient height above the chockstone via the Tricky Traverse; downclimb into the snow filled gully above the chockstone, and climb upwards along the side of the snow where it meets the rock until the notch is reached. Cross over to the other side of the notch. Once upon the other side of the notch, there is a short but technical section of solid 5.7 climbing past 2 fixed pitons allowing access to the upper slopes that approach the Second Tower. Upon examination, the upper of the 2 pitons was loose to the touch, but the lower of the 2 seemed to be OK. This bit of climbing really feels like more of a slippery boulder problem than a full pitch of climbing. Also the exposure is not near as great here as it feels like on the Tricky Traverse just below.  Notch to Second Tower  When you climb out of the notch, continue upwards on slopes that are very similar to the beginning of the East Ridge; i.e. not too steep, rather more like 4th class in nature. I was drawn to the crest of the ridge, but this really only served a purpose of showing me how I needed to proceed around the Second Tower and into the notch that would connect me with the upper snow slopes. The key to turning the Second Tower lies in finding a break in the tower on the left side (south) that is similar in which access was gained to the window on the Molar Tooth. In other words, keep traversing around to the left or south until it is easy to climb up and gain a window in the crest of the ridge itself that allows an easy access back to the north side of the tower. If this sounds confusing; perhaps it is better to take a visit to the ridge crest itself as you are approaching the Second Tower in order to suss out the difficulty of obtaining the face which will allow you to traverse beneath the north side of its face.  Once you get onto the north side of the Second Tower, make a delicate, up and down traverse across the tower to get to the notch. Find a huge detached flake and traverse behind it. There may be several rappel slings in the area where it appeared that people were rappelling across this section instead of climbing it. The Ortenburger/Jackson guide next describes climbing a chimney that becomes flakey as you get higher into it. To me this seemed more like a short bouldery section that involved yarding on chossy and broken rock; more of that brown acid type of climbing However, it doesnt last for too long, and once you get to the top of this section, it is just a short, easy traverse to get into the notch itself.  Upper Snow Fields  Depending on the time of year, it may be necessary to put on your crampons at this point in order to go across a bit of a snow field to get to the other side of the notch. Once across the notch, ascend in an upwards traverse to the right to reach the crest of the ridge where the north face meets the East Ridge. The exposure here is exhilarating as you get to look down over the North Face and North Ridge routes. There are also a couple of really neat looking bivy sites if the time of day is late or you are into that sort of thing. Perhaps these might also give some insight into just how involved this climb is for being a mere grade III. At some point you will be forced into climbing up onto the snow slopes above. At first, ascend the snow slopes along the crest of the ridge, and then start making a rising traverse back to the left, aiming for a break in the rock band beneath an obvious chimney through the summit block. This chimney is described as the original route of ascent; however a more appealing option is available if you continue traversing to the left (South) until you reach a break in the summit block that is simpler looking in what it will take to reach the top. There are a number of different options for climbing the summit block, such as going back to the right, towards the North Face; so pick whichever way seems most reasonable to you. Once I got off the snow, I chose the left most variation for solving the summit block. From atop the summit block; climb on an angle back to the right (North) in order to gain the highest point on the summit. Pat yourself on the back for a route well climbed! Descend via the Owen-Spalding route.

route_description: An historic 11p route up a sea of granite on the South buttress of Mt. Moran.  When combined with the upper ridge to the summit, this is the longest route in the lower 48.  I would be surprised if there is a longer rock route in N. America.  The first ascent (1953), the exposure, the paddle in, and the setting, make this a classic.    Climb (5.3) for about 400-500' up a gulley to the second ledge. This gulley is located about 100yds past some trees and the prow (though it is probably possible to climb up some 5.5 to 5.8 almost anywhere from the first to second ledges). Move west about 50-100' and climb 5.7 or 5.9 crack to another ledge system 50' above.  Follow this ledge system up and west for about 300-400'.  The real climbing now begins up beautiful solid granite.  Two, 200' pitches can bring you to the top of a huge detached flake.  From the top of the flake some 5.8/5.9 pg-13 climbing (50-75') brings you around an arete to some spectacular exposure at the double pendulum pitch. Two pendulums or an 11d traverse bring you to a 4-move aid section followed by some 4th class.  The 4-move aid section can apparently be climbed free at 12a- though you would need some small finger tips.  The final pitch follows an amazing handtraverse back east for about 100'.  This will leave you at a large bowl with some trees and bushes.  Water is sometimes available in a spring here and the rappels begin to east of the bowl.     Continuing to the summit will make this climb several times more difficult.  Apparently, good route finding can allow 5.4 scrambling over about 3000' of climbing to the summit.  We moved up to the ridge and soloed consistent, extremely exposed knife-edge climbing (5.6) for 1000. It appeared to me that staying below the ridge would allow easier climbing.  When faced with a notch and headwall move a few hundred yards east/NE to continue to summit.

route_description: A classic climb in a beautiful location. Although the CMC Route is the most popular route on Mount Moran, it does not see a lot of traffic compared to other Teton trade routes. On a summer day there are usually 3 or fewer parties attempting the CMC Route.  While a fast party can climb the route in a day, it is more leisurely to use the CMC campground for the night before (and possibly the night after) the climb. A backcountry permit is required to use the CMC campground (available from the climbing rangers at Jenny Lake).  The usual approach is to canoe across String and Leigh Lakes to a point below the East and West Horns on the east side of Mount Moran. From the base of the lake an obvious but eroded trail leads up the hillside among beautiful wildflowers for about 1500 feet to the CMC campsite. The trail traverses left (south) just below the campsite; follow cairns and tape on some trees.  The CMC campsite is located among trees and near a spring. It has beautiful views and feels pleasantly secluded.  To climb the CMC route, first hike to the summit of Drizzlepuss, descend into the notch between Drizzlepuss and the east face of Moran, then climb the east face of Moran.   From the CMC campsite a trail goes to the top of Drizzlepuss with some scrambling. The trail can be difficult to follow in the dark, so it helps to scout where it goes before a pre-dawn start. Watch the cairns carefully to find the easiest fourth class route through the cliff bands. If you miss the easiest scramble, you may find yourself on fifth class ground and want to rope up. After this steep section, follow the scree slope, heading left around the West Horn, to the top of Drizzlepuss. This is a good location to leave extra water or packs for the descent.  From the top of Drizzlepuss, scramble down a short distance to the right (north) to find an rappel anchor. From this anchor you can rap or downclimb into the notch.  The interesting climbing starts from this notch. Initially the climb heads up a short corner, then traverses right (north) to avoid Unsoeld's needle. After the traverse pick a path up the broad east face of Moran, staying to the left of the prominent Black Dike. There are many possible lines up the face. The traditional CMC route stays near the center of the face. Several pitches of climbing lead to the top of the face.  From the broad summit ridge, it is an easy walk right (north) to the proper summit of Mount Moran.  The descent is somewhat involved. With careful routefinding it is only fourth-class downclimbing and does not require rappelling; if the correct route isn't found it may be more difficult. The descent stays near the south end of the east face of Moran (climber's left). From the notch between the face and Drizzlepuss, climb back up to the summit of Drizzlepuss. This is easier if you stay to the south (climber's right) of Drizzlepuss.  The remainder of the descent just reverses the hike back to the CMC campground and the lake.

route_description: This is a bit of an adventure climb, I will describe it as best I recall, but we certainly followed our noses a bit.  Once in the Warrior I basin (a bit to the north/left of the peak), we scrambled up the grassy ledges rightward. Eventually, we were cliffed out and roped up:  P1 & P2: Follow chossy ramp system angling up and right (5.5ish maybe). We did this in 2 pitches, with a bit of simulclimbing, to a large ledge.  P3: The wall becomes more imposing and the route is not obvious here. The route is supposed to "use thin holds for 30 ft, then cross a slab to the left and climb a crack..." I climbed straight up into a dirty unprotected flake system (scary 10 and my second ripped off a nub and fell here), then traversed right on decent holds . There seemed to be other variations, either left or right of that line, presumably they are safer and a lot easier. There is an obvious niche about 120 ft up, that I did find without trouble.  P4. Out of the niche there are two obvious cracks, we went for the right of them, which wound up being wide and strenuous (9+). At the top, there was a good belay.  P5. The next pitch went up corner crack of a large block, to a nice landing area, which is tempting to belay on - but better to push on and extend the pitch, gaining the summit of the smaller pillar.  P6. The "solitary crack in the headwall" - this is the pitch you can fight over. 100 ft of 2 - 3" crack to a slab, at the top of which you can belay.   P7. We exited right, which was an awkward escape from the slab followed by a short step down, then 25 ft of ow/chimney. Then to the summit...  Descent was straight-forward, rapping down (2 ropes) to the climbers-left of the route.

route_description: This climb is 3 pitches.  The formation just sort of jets out of a flat field;..there are dirt roads directly to the base of the formation.  The first pitch (climbs the pedestal) starts on the right side of the East Face and diagonals up and left to a ledge at the base of the actual steep "headwall" section. The first pitch is sort of loose, sort of junky, and about 5.8.  Pitch two is where the "business" starts;  make a 5.9 move to a ledge, traverse right to the main crack and start aid climbing (A2 on cams and wires) to a bolt ladder (about 5 bolts), then back to the crack (A1) to a sling belay from 3 bolts.  The last pitch is wild, in that you are climbing a fin of rock that is probably only 6-10 feet thick to the other side!.....(It's wide enough and you don't even realize just how thin it is until you get to the top and straddle the summit.)  The last pitch opens up a bit, to about 2 1/2 Friend size (many)...and ends up at bolts (and pins?) on the tiny summit. Rappel to the top of pitch one, then to the ground.

route_description: The Mace is a classic Sedona route, and one of the "must do" lines in the area.  If you're used to Moab area towers, this is a bit of a disappointment in terms of rock quality, but the adventure itself is wonderful.  Approach from a small trailhead off of Back O' Beyond Road in Sedona. The hike is 15-20 minutes at a leisurely pace.  P1: Climb up chimney (or the runout face to the right) to a crack through limestone band. Pull a small roof to gain a big alcove with eyebolt belay.  5.7.  P2: Head up a handcrack in the back corner of alcove, into a chimney, breaking left at top and continuing up an offwidth crack in the corner.  A final corner leads to an eyebolt belay on top of a small pillar. 5.9.  P3: Clip a bolt off the left side of the pillar and perform an airy traverse left to gain a crack system.  Climb this to reach a small triangular belay ledge with another eyebolt belay.  P4: Pass through a slot to the west, then move right and climb a crack system to an alcove about halfway up.  From here, chimney and offwidth (crux) past a bolt.  This leads to the summit of the lower tower and an eyebolt belay.  P5: Lean across to the higher tower, clip a bolt, and traverse right and climb up to gain an easier slab to the top. Belay off a strange anchor bolted to the summit.  Descent: Rappel to lower summit (or do the jump... bad idea).  Double rope rap from here to a ledge, then another double rope rap to the saddle behind the tower.

route_description: A great route on a great tower with stunning scenery and no crowds.    The climb starts up a face about 15' left (up-gully) of the left side of the obvious corner/gully on the North Face.  From Turkish Bride, walk up and left up "The Bowling Alley" to just past the big corner system shown on the Turkish Bride topo.  P1:  Walk up the gully (left) for about 15', then traverse right to the first bolt.  You can see the bolt from the ground, but not from the start of the traverse.  Continue up some funky face moves past a couple more bolts to a limestone band.  Then traverse a few moves right to a 2-bolt anchor at the base of the first window. (5.10a)  P2: Stem and bridge up the beautiful chimney past 2 bolts and a small cam placement to a roof crack.  Jam the crack out of the chimney (west) and pull up into an excellent dihedral.  Follow dihedral to the second window and another 2 bolt anchor.  A stellar pitch with great moves!  (5.10b/c)  P3: Another good pitch!  Continue up the nice dihedral as it starts to get wider; bring some big gear for this pitch. Towards the top the crack gets steeper and wider, but a convenient chockstone and a rail on each side make this easier than it looks.  After grunting though the last bulge, finish up a short ramp to the notch, then scramble up the face to the summit and a 2-bolt anchor.  (5.10b)  Rap the route to descend.  We used a single 70m rope, but a 60m would PROBABLY work.

route_description: Sedona Scenic Cruise is a pretty cool moderate outing that has been gaining popularity over the last few years. The crux is often figuring out where the route is located. If you look east from highway 179 between Bell Rock and the Church Spires, there is a jagged high ridge of rock running roughly North-South. SSC goes up the leftmost formation on this ridge. At first glance, the rock looks way too shattered to be a good place for a climbing route, but surprisingly, it's pretty good.  P1) 120' Climb up corner to a big flake sticking out to the left. The crux of the pitch is skirting this flake out to the left. (tiny cam or Lowe Ball useful here). Above the flake, continue to a two-bolt anchor (no chains). From here, you can look out to the right (climber's right) and see RAPPEL ANCHOR for the last rappel.  P2) 160' Scramble around to the left and up onto the ledge with large tree. Set pro for anchor. Second pitch starts behind the tree, up face past several bolts and a two bolt anchor at the top, continue climbing, veer right across a slab and one bolt, then up a short corner to a bolted belay on a ledge.  P3) ~175' all the way to the blocky ledges. Traverse straight left, clip bolt, continue left and up (bolt), then into a corner system. Climb this to a nice looking vertical crack, then step up and jam your way up the steep hands to big hands crack (pretty good face holds as well). A short chimney bit will put you left of a sloping ledge with the bolted anchor w/chains (note this as a RAPPEL ANCHOR for the way back down). You can continue up to the left up a short face with a single bolt and combine this pitch with the next one. There are two bolts with no chains at the end of this.  P4) 100' Face climb up and right along the right side of buttress past 10 bolts to belay on ledge. Very nice pitch. You can see a long chain on the ledge just north from here that is the RAPPEL ANCHOR on the way down.  P5) 100' Climb around corner to the right across "spicy" traverse to gain chimney with chockstone. Climb up and over chockstone and continue up crack to belay on ledge. There is a small canister with a summit register here and RAPPEL ANCHOR.  You can scramble (4th cl) to the top from here. Highly recommend belaying this portion!  Descent:  R1) Rappel from the last anchor back down to the top of the fourth pitch (85'). If you have a 60m rope, it's probably easier to leave your second rope here rather than hauling it to the top.  R2) Airy rappel (TWO ROPES!) from the long chains back down to the sloping ledge with chains noted in P3 description above. Watch the rope pull on this as the blocky ledge above tends to eat the ropes.  R3) Rappel (TWO ROPES) off the sloping ledge down to a two bolt anchor with slings and a rap ring at the top of the vertical section of the second pitch. You're headed for a bolted anchor with chains down a slot just below the buttress where the second pitch starts.  R4) Rappel (TWO ROPES) back down to the ground, just South and around the corner from the first pitch.

route_description: This is a great route up a huge corner then out an equally huge roof.  If MP.com had an option to rate this 5.9+++ I would have rated it so.  It gets shade in the am & a mix of sun & shade in the pm.  Most people only do the first 3 pitches then rap, which is what we did.  As the guidebook says: "If you are going to the top make sure your affairs are in order."  If anyone here has climbed all the way to the top please contribute the info.    P1: Start up easier ground through some loose rock to good rock in a nice corner.  Ascend corner to a gear belay on a ledge. (5.9+)  P2: Continue up corner to a bolted belay just a bit before the roof. (5.9)  It MIGHT be possible to link the first 2 pitches with a 70m rope, lots of slings, and a strong leader.  P3: Continue up a short bit to the huge roof.  Traverse right for forever to an awkward but good rest in a big pod, then continue right some more to the lip.  Pull around the lip (#4 Camalot) then up cracks for another 20-30' to a bolted anchor. (5.9+)

route_description: Earth Angel is an awesome route that climbs what must be one of the largest sandstone towers in the United States.  The first two pitches are laden with loose rock, so use caution.  The last four pitches are four stars for climbing quality.  This is also one of the best summits in Sedona.  Pitch 1 - Walk to the right edge of the large starting platform.  Climb a short crack then wander up broken rock and ledges to a nice belay ledge next to the Chimney.  (5.7 ~120')  Watch for loose rock on this pitch.  Pitch 2 - Climb chimney off belay being mindful of loose rock.  Belay at nice ledge on left at the top of the chimney.  (5.7 ~180')  Pitch 3 - Step across chimney and climb off-width crack above.  Jam, stem, off-width, and face climb past one bolt (pitch crux) to the top of this excellent pitch.  Everytime this pitch starts to really become difficult a Red Rocks style face hold seemed to magically appear.  Belay from a huge ledge at the top of this pitch.  (5.10- ~150')  Pitch 4 - Climb the left side of a pillar up a hands to fingers crack.  Belay at the top of this pillar.  Some say this is the best pitch on the route.  The first asensionists tunneled behind/through the pillar and climbed the right side.   (5.9 ~100')  Pitch 5 - Traverse up and right to a finger crack that is not directly visible from the belay ledge.  Climb up this crack and then onto the face above past an old bolt and pin.  Once through the major difficulties trend up and right over large chickenheads to another huge ledge and belay.  (5.10- ~140')  This pitch carries some serious climbing above an old bolt and pin.  Send the best lead head and face climber up on this pitch.  Pitch 6 - There are many ways to climb the final pitch ranging from 5.7 to 5.10x.  The described way was our path of least resistance, but there are probably 5 or 6 different ways to climb this last pitch.  Climb a moderate crack system directly off the belay ledge until an easy traverse left leads to the tower's north face.  From here 5.6 face climbing takes you to one of the best summit's in Sedona.  Look for the first rap anchor on the far side of the summit.

A single #4 Camalot or equivalent should suffice, although another large piece may be deisired if not sliding the pro with you. Smaller sized gear (2-3") is utilized to set an anchor.  Perhaps somewhat intimidating in appearance, this protects well and is surprisingly fun. All in all a worthwhile route that merits one star out of five.

route_description: As you approach the area, you will see several blocks near each other.  Baserkerville Rock is the leftmost of these formations.  This route follows the crack furthest to the right on Baskerville Rock.  Face climb for 15 feet until you reach a stance where one can place bomber pro.  This is where the crux begins.  The beauty of this route is that you'll get great stances to place gear, but the climbing never really eases off either.  Enjoy!

route_description: Hidden but a short distance from the crowds at Trashcan Rock is this gem of a route which if it were roadside would see almost constant traffic.  Climb a short slab, or as an alternative traverse in from the left, to reach the base of the crack which starts with a short vertical section of fingers and hands. Above this is a ledge and another short section with fingers and some stemming/liebacking to reach a second ledge. The last bit climbs up and right on face holds until able to traverse back left to reach good hand jams which lead to the top and the anchors.  The variety of moves on this coupled with the setting make for a tradtastic experience. Three stars out of five.

route_description: This leaning, almost bombay squeeze chimney is great entertainment for climbers and spectators alike. If you go with the proper side in, the crux is a few feet below where it turns the lip onto the vertical face.  Good squeeze technique will see you through the crux, then you're into the fists and soon onto the face where the crack is low angle & easy. If setting a TR on this, be prepared with a good length of static line, you'll want to extend the anchor quite a ways below the top due to a rope pinching chockstone in the crack.

On the south side of Star Wars Rock are several right-slanting cracks.  Light Sabre is the rightmost, with a small right-facing corner for the first half, a bulge, then a straight-in crack for the top.  You can't walk by without being drawn in by its siren song. Expect a variety of jams, from locker fingers to off-hands, and a good solid pump.

Expect a mix of side-pulls and face holds with your jams for the bottom section.  At the top, the crack fades into the face so you must smear to the summit.  It's more technical and devious than Light Sabre, and a bit more work to set the gear, but overall it's a worthy pitch.  If it seems a little out of your league, run up Thumbs Down Left or Light Sabre and string a top-rope - you'll be glad you did.

route_description: Climb the obvious right-slanting crack using jams and lieback moves (it's often easier to keep one foot on the face for balance) until encountering a roof high on the route. A good rest is found here, so plug in some gear and pull the roof (crux) before topping out onto a nice ledge with a bolted anchor/rap. 100' rap from anchors or one can continue above the anchors and descend the slabby south face of the formation. Note: don't try rappelling with anything less than a 60 meter rope as it won't reach.  This excellent climb is a Josh classic and a must do route of the area as it's a long, varied pitch on good rock with a tricky start, a fun middle section and an exciting finish.   Some climbers may remember seeing this climb featured on the cover of the 1989 Joshua Tree supplemental guide. Another name for this climb is The Kandy-Kolored Tangerine-Flake Streamline Baby, the name of a 1965 novel by Tom Wolfe.

Also, there is a large flake in the chimney about 2/3 of the way up that is expanding and could get ripped out.  Watch out for that.  It's near the section where everything sounds hollow and you pray you don't fall on your gear.  This end of Sentinel is a bit chossy.  Illusion Dweller end is by far much better.

route_description: This right arching, flaring squeeze with a fist crack in the back starts straight up and eventually curves all the way over to horizontal traversing before it ends at a giant horn feature at the edge of the squeeze chimney of Where Janitors Dare. The crux comes at about the 30' level just before the traversing starts, transitioning from sort of chimneying to a few lieback moves.  The initial section of rock is pretty good, especially inside the flare itself, but where it starts traversing the rock turns extremely rotten. The route was rated 5.8 in older guides, which would be a pretty good sandbag.  A better way to finish this route is to climb to the beginning of the traverse where Great White Buffalo crosses through (bolt just above) and finish on the Buffalo. This gives you the best (and crux) section of Flared Bear, skips the choss, and ups the difficulty a bit. Done this way the overall crux would be the first 8' after leaving Flared Bear, on a tenuous steep lieback to mantle and would weigh in around 10+. The remainder is slightly easier standard Josh slab paddling on very good rock.

To belay, you can simply loop some giant plates on top for an anchor and then use the rap anchors to the left atop Runaway to descend. If you wish you can walk off, although this is long and involved. One positive aspect is it takes you past the Solosby face. Four stars out of five

route_description:  What a classic line!   Approach Sports Challenge Rock on the southeast side and scamble down into the shaded "slot" on that side. Near the left end of the east face, and just left of an large pine tree, you'll see a prominent curving crack that starts about 20 feet off the ground and arcs upward to the top of the rock. A few scoops and seams lead up though steep terrain to this crack.    Boulder up scoops and seams up and left through a slight overhang, placing a few good nuts along the way. These will be #4-#8 BD Stoppers or eq size (if memory serves me); small TCU's may also work. The crux is body english and slopers. Reach a great jam some 25' up and start placing cams. The crack starts as a left-leaning feature, but arcs its way through the rock, eventually becoming a right-leaner. This great climb offers good face climbing as well as good jamming, from thin-hands to fists.    Tape up and enjoy a classic!

route_description: Info courtesy of  Widefetish.com  This is a good route with cool moves low and fine example of squeeze chimney up high.  The various guidebooks (Vogel, Bartlett) have lines all over this crag, none really describing this route. The actual Couldn't Wait is rumored to start on the two bolt face to the right of the pillar, and then wanders back over to the wide. Climb the corner instead of the two bolt face.  Be wary of the fake loose block in the starting corner. You can pro below the block and the moves around it are not hard.  Our crew did the wide right side in and left side in. Pick your poison.  If you have the hips of a Thai crossdresser, you can get right inside the chimney from the get-go and stay in there. If you are more voluptuous, the constriction at the start will force you to the outside.  Descent is off the back heading South to SouthWest down some ledges and ramps.

route_description: I don't know...unless it's 1000 feet off the deck, C1 can be pretty monotonous. In any case, this route is worth doing for the exposure on the last pitch alone! It is also a good practice route for bigger and better things.  I understand this can be a pretty crowded route on weekends so if you're planning on doing a one day ascent, you might as well forget about it if you get behind a party that's hauling. It gets good sun (SW facing) so it can be done comfortably in cooler weather.  The common strategy for this route seems to be to fix the lower section the first day and then come back the next day and fire to the top.  A trail leads to the base of the climbing, a short section of sandy rock that leads to a ramp.  P1 (Easy 5th) Begin by climbing up sandy rock to the large, left-trending ledge/ramp above. Follow the ramp to the base of a chimney (identified by a tree about 10 feet up the chimney).  P2 (5.6/5.7) Climb the fun chimney to a belay (two drilled pins) on a large ledge. If you are fixing a line from here, you may want to back the belay up with a cam (#3 Camalot). We had a 70m rope but a 60m should be able to reach the ground if fixing.  P3 (5.5) Walk around right and climb a sandy trough up to a ledge at the base of the headwall.  P4 (C1) This is where the steepness begins.  Aid the bolt ladder and eventually a thin crack on a steep slab, reaching a belay where the wall steepens.  P5 (C2) Continue up the crack system to a belay.  Skip this belay and tension right into a thin seam.  Aid the seam (crux) with creative nutwork and continue up to the next anchor. The seam aids perfectly fine with nuts, offsets, and tricams, so leave the cam hooks at home (camhooks aren't exactly clean aid pieces in sandstone)   P6 (C1) The crack at this point widens enough that it can be free-climbed at a reasonable grade. The guides claim 5.10 but it looks a bit harder and very sustained.  If you're still in aid mode, as is likely the case, continue upwards in your aiders to the second set of anchors.  P7 (C1) This pitch looks like it might actually be 5.10.  The crack leans pretty seriously to the right by this point, making retreat difficult.  Continue aiding upwards to the enormous Solar Orbit Ledge which looks like a good, but slopey, bivy.  P8 (C1) This is the cool part!  Traverse the ledge to the far right side, surmount the roof, and aid the bolt ladder to the top.  Make sure you look down for a while at the lip of the roof... big exposure!  The second has the option of taking a running swing into space at the lip (highly recommended).  Topo

parent_url: /v/moonlight-buttress/105717003 
route_description: This route is great. The line can be spotted from the road as a distinct dihedral with a roof/chimney at the top that runs up just past half way. The rock looks blank above that but a beautiful, direct, crack system runs almost the whole way up. This is a great easy aid route or a hardcore free climb on beautiful crack systems.  The belays are all bolted and the bolts are in great condition (thanks to the ASCA, I think). A hammer is nice for cleaning but do not nail anything on the route.  The start is a pain in the ass. On the far left side of the 3rd class ledges, locate a right angling ramp. It is somewhat obvious.  P1 (5.8+, ~200') Climb the ramp, step right, and follow short hand cracks to the bolt anchors. Pull up the haul line and throw it down to the pig. This is the worst hauling on the route (except the top).  There is a direct 5.10 variation that would make this much easier. This pitch is not so well protected but it is not too bad.  P2 (C1, ~100') Traverse far right and start aiding up the shallow right facing dihedral just after a small roof. Follow the crack system to a nice belay ledge in an acute dihedral with a bolt anchors.  This pitch could be free climbed at 5.10.  P3 (C1, ~100') The angling bolt ladder. Mostly QDs and a hook. Walk right on the ledge and stretch up to the first clip. Follow the line of bolts and drilled pins to where there are two pins next to each other.  From here we believe you do a free move then hook move to the next bolt. We decided it would be faster to do a long stick clip with the pole from the ledge's fly. We were told by a party later that the day before the pin had pulled or fell out so they hammered it back in. What ever you do here be careful as it is not a good pin at all. It is dead vertical so the fall is clean but it would be long and involve a swing.  This pitch ends on the rocker block with bolt anchors.  P4 (C1+, ~180') The Grand Dihedral. Clip two bolts and enjoy leap frogging cams up the steepening dihedral. This a beautiful pitch; long, so have plenty of carabiners and cams/nuts to take you the whole way (or back clean). Have the #2 and #3 cams for the couple of wider parts.  This is the first of the hanging belays from bolts.  P5 (C1+, ~150') Continue up the steep dihedral and decipher the step left on a hook. We used the big bros to aid the initial part of the chimney/v-slot and they worked great.  Follow the shallow dihedral system for another long pitch to an awesome ledge. There is a series of bolts along this ledge to accommodate bivies. A double portaledge is nice for comfort but one could sleep on the natural ledge. (Aahhhhh...sleep!)  P6 (C1, ~100') The beginning of the nice splitter crack system. OK stance, bolt anchors.  P7 (C1, ~100') Same stuff. Decent stance, bolt anchors.   P8 (C1+, ~100') The rock here turns into a rather broken crack system for a little ways. Watch where you place gear because some of the blocks seemed loose (although they didn't move).  Somewhat tricky; hanging belay, bolt anchors.  P9 (C1 5.7, ~130') Continue up the splitter clack system to a small roof with hand-sized pro. This can be free climbed at 5.10.  Arrive at a small ledge with the final 5.7 slabs. Belay here or run up the scary slabs. We belayed here and brought up the second to finish up the slabs.  The 5.7 slab is about thirty feet long and there are about two pro placements (red cam and red alien). Traverse right, up, back left, up to the top. It would be very scary without rock shoes. There are a couple of trees to belay off of on top.  When hauling at the top, it would be best to extend the tie-in to be over the lip. Otherwise you will only get it up with a Z-pulley and you will deepen the grooves in the lip. Be ready for the gawking tourists as the trail is only about 100 feet away.  For the meat of the route you don't need any hand-sized or larger gear (#1 cam and up) except for the 5.10 pitches and the chimney. Most of  the pitches are TCUs and nuts and an occasional small hand-sized piece.  It would have been nice to leave the hand-sized pieces in the top of the pig and tag them up when needed. Be ready for the typical free move in the middle of an aid pitch.  If you know what you are doing it would be reasonable to do it in a day. You can fix lines down the rap route from the rocker block with 2 ropes. You can bivy on the rocker block but the best one is at the top of P5. There are no other good places to bivy as they are all hanging belays.  The route gets morning sun and is shaded after about 2pm or so.

route_description: P1/P2 (C1, 160') The first bolt is about nine feet off the ground (have your buddy give you a boost to clip it).  The first two pitches can be combined.  P3 (~70') Gain a comfortable ledge.    P4 (C2) Attack the Wrinkles which calls for a series of pendulums (reach right) and tension traverses to the left. When good placements run out move left.  P5 (C1) Climbs through the arch roof via a nice crack.  P6 (C1) Takes a crack to a short bolt ladder.   P7 (C2) Takes a left-facing corner up a few trickier moves to a decent stance for the last aid pitch.    P8 Continues up the corner system and then makes a clever pendulum out left to gain access to another corner.  (Fixed point) This pitch ends on a big, dirty, sandy, down sloping ledge (be extremely careful of the loose stuff here).    P9 (5.5) Free climbs a low-angle chimney filled with loose debris to a ridiculously crappy chute filled with loose sand, rock, and plant material.  After suffering through this mess, you arrive at a good trees to belay from.  A few recommendations:  1. Bring a belay seat as the stances are not always very comfortable.  2. Do not haul if you can help it.  If you think you'll take more than one day, fix the first two or three pitches.

parent_url: /v/black-velvet-wall/105732162 
route_description: This is it.  THE classic red rocks route.  And it's just as good as everyone says it is.  Approach as for the Black Velvet wall.  After climbing around the chockstone, return to the stream bed and walk another minute or two upstream.  The bolts on the first pitch will be easily spotted on the left.  This route has lost some of the original seriousness now that bolted anchors have been placed all the way up.  This speeds things up considerably and provides an easy retreat if needed.  You'll need two ropes if you intend to rap the route.  The original description had 18 pitches.  If you use the bolted belay anchors you can climb Epinephrine in 11 or 12 pitches.  This description will assume that you use the bolted belays.  It's hard to remember precisely how long (or how many!) pitches are on this route but I'll do my best.  Pitch 1: climb out of the creekbed past bolts to a big ledge (5.8).  Continue on past a couple more bolts to a bushy ledge. (165 feet, 5.8)  Pitch 2: work up and left into a chimney, then pull out the right side and work up easier rock to the base of the big chimney that forms the right side of the Black Tower.(165 feet?, 5.7).  May need some rope stretch here.  Pitch 3: The main event: chimney up a wide crack with good pro to a ledge on the right wall with bolts.  (140', 5.9)  Pitch 4: Chimney up and swing left as the crack narrows.  Climb easier rock to a good ledge.  Belay or continue on up into a narrower chimney with a fixed nut at the base and then two bolts.  The bolts can be hard to spot - you need to work away from the back of the chimney to find them.  If you have enough rope you can belay at the top of the Black Tower.  Otherwise belay at the top of the chimney and do a short easy pitch to the tower's top.  You can avoid the lower part of the chimney on the right.  (165', 5.9)  Pitch 5: Climb the face above the top of the tower, passing an overhang, aiming at a brushy ledge.  (150', 5.8)  Pitch 6: Traverse easily right to the Elephant's Trunk.  Ascend this to a ledge at its top.  (80', 5.6)  Pitch 7: Climb up the crack system (some bolts) to a bolted belay at a ledge.  (90', 5.8+)  (can be combined with Pitch 6).  The rap route goes straight down from here, avoiding pitches 5 and 6.  Pitches 8 - 10: Continue up the same crack system, stopping at the bolted belays.  A short traverse right (bolt) is found on pitch 10. (400', 5.8+)   Pitch 11: Either rap the route of continue to the top of the crack. There is no rap anchor at the top of the pitch, though you'll see some chopped bolts where there used to be an anchor.   Route exit: You've finished the 5th class climbing, but you're not done yet. There is about 600 feet of 4th class/5.2 slab that you need to climb. If you feel bold, you may choose to unrope and free-solo, or you and your partner can simulclimb the rest of the way up. Otherwise, you can build anchors and place a little gear as you go.   Follow the right leaning ramp all the way to the very top. It ends just after turning into a very well defined right-facing dihedral, where you might find yourself mantling on the face behind you as you climb. If you are doing this part of the climb at night, you'll want to keep an eye out for an "exit" to the right, after passing through the dihedral section. You'll arrive at a large ledge at the top of the dihedral. If you try to keep going straight up, you'll encounter a 12 foot sandy/sometimes-wet "wall". Don't climb that wall.  You'll step right 30 feet, and make a few moves to turn a corner.   Keep in mind that for this entire ramp section, you will not be able to see the famous pine tree or 4th class exit-pitch. Just keep trending up and right.   Once you round the corner, you'll come to a very large sandy ledge protected by a roof. Proceed along the ledge, take the rightward facing ramp that's plainly visible ahead, and congratulate you and your partner for a job well done.   Descent: follow cairns along the ridge leading east from the summit.  There are a lot of cairns - if you miss them backtrack until you get back on the right trail.  The route will eventually drop left towards Whiskey Peak at the top of Frogland.  Protection: You don't need anything bigger than a #4 camalot in the chimney pitches.  A 3, 3.5, and 4 camalot and perhaps a #11 hex, combined with the existing fixed gear, should get you up the chimney without much mental stress.  Logistics: Getting a pack through the chimney pitches is a pain - go light and bring a long sling to trail the pack when needed.  The route gets almost no sun so you can go fairly light on water.  Get an early start and move fast!  Most of the climbing is 5.7 - 5.8.  If you can avoid wasting time at the belays you should be able to get up in a day without too much effort.  A competent party can easily get up in 8 hours.  Figure on about 1 - 1.5 hours in descent.  Don't leave gear at the base of the route if you chose to walk down - it's a long way out of the way to go back there.  If the chimney pitches were in Yosemite they would be 5.7.  This isn't Steck-Salathe! 5.9 is consistent with other Vegas ratings though.    Here's the step by step descent by Jon P (thanks!)  1. Head up to the summit of Black Velvet peak by rounding the big lone pine tree at the top of the route and scrambling which quickly eases into hiking. Enjoy the view of Vegas.  2. When looking out at Las Vegas from Black Velvet peak, turn to face your 4:00 (right and slightly behind you), seeing another very large peak connected by a ridge and saddle. Follow this ridge, dropping down the saddle, and make your way up to the top of the large peak.  3. Once at the summit of the 2nd tall peak, look to your 8:00 (left and slightly behind) to see another ridge heading toward hwy 160.  4. Scramble down the large peak to obtain this next ridge. Stay as high as safely possible as you follow the ridge which is sporadically marked with cairns.  5. Connect the dots along the ridge, hitting 3 or 4 more peaks as you follow the ridge. Only one of the peaks does not have a cairn on it but continue high on the ridge heading to the top of each peak.  6. You will know when you are at the final peak because it has 4 or 5 very stout cairns on it closely spaced. It is obvious! If you are unsure then you are not there yet!  7. Once on top of the peak with the 4 or 5 big cairns, head left and down following the many cairns along the way. If you head down and do not see cairns, you are going the wrong way.  8. Get dumped into the whisky peak gully decent (turn right when you come to the fork) and continue down behind Frogland, following trails and cairns which are heading in the direction of hwy 160. There are multiple trails going down this decent and they all seem to meet up eventually.  9. Upon exiting the gully, curve around whisky peak following the trail that curves left.  10. The decent trail back to the parking lot is several hundred feet before Frogland, marked with a large cairn sitting on top of a large boulder.

In the first half of the climb you can choose to lieback the crack or employ off-width jamming and in the second half the crack is wide enough to chimney. Walk off left.

route_description: A great route!  And VERY popular.  Start early.  For the approach, take the trail that skirts the pink cliff band on the left.  Work your way around the cliff band and to the right.  Look for a huge roof capping a large slab and make your way to the crack on the right side of this feature.  Scramble up a few 4th-class sections to the a nice terrace and the beginning of a LF corner/crack that has a few bolts (why?)...    P1: 5.7, 150'  Climb a crack in a block (awkward) to gain the left-facing corner/crack.  Climb this for a nice long pitch and belay on the second of two big ledges.  Tree anchor.  P2: 5.7, 150'  Work right from the belay and climb a lower-angle crack in a LF corner to a ledge.  From here (a) Make a few exciting moves out left and up a crack to another ledge. Or (b) continue straight up through a wide overhanging flake/crack section to a small ledge.  P3: 5.6, 100'  Work out left into a nice right-facing dihedral, up this, then out right through a small overhang and belay at the base of an obtuse corner with some thin face moves to the right.  The next 3 pitches are PG so be ready for some spice!  P4: 5.8, 140'  Climb out left of the thin corner on small edges and thin pro.  Gain a decent crack that climbs up to the right side of the giant roof clipping an old pin along the way.  Check out the slabby leftward traverse under the roof which marks the crux of the route.  Make the delicate moves across to a thin crack and up about 40' to a small belay stance that takes 1.5-3" gear.  Awesome!  P5: 5.8, 130'  Make some PG face moves up to a bolt.  Climb up left to a huge chockstone and tunnel behind it.  Work up and right into a right-facing corner and up to a ledge with tricky belay gear.  P6: 5.6, 160'?  Work out right onto the face and let the better gear lead your way up to a small bulge at the top.  Turn the bulge and head up 5.2 terrain to the top.  This pitch is broken up into 2 pitches in the book but we've always done it as one with a 60m rope.  Descent:  Follow the cairns. Pick your way over the peak and down into the gully. Go down the white rock on the left side of the gully. Take the gully down and to the left and contour around the mountain and back to the base of the climb.

route_description: The Misunderstanding starts about 50' left of Mazatlan. Look for a crack in a corner running through dark varnished rock.Pitch 1- climb easy ground, up slightly sandy white rock. Aim for the obvious cracks on the right side of the corner. Traverse left under the roof and pull over the top, onto the belay ledge, belay from 2 good bolts(70'- 5.9).Pitch 2- The meat of the route!! Climb the obvious varnished crack that you've been admiring!! At the top of the crack is another white roof, climb right under the roof to reach another short wide section. Once you reach the corner of the roof you'll see the next anchor, which is semi-hanging.To descend rappel the route with 1 rope(50M).

route_description: This is one of my favorite climbs in Red Rocks.  It is varied, steep, long and challenging with perfect rock.  This route has some great crack climbing but the real excitement comes from the reasonably bolted face sections.  The exposure is fantastic and the whole route is well protected.  DOWT is deservedly very popular and given the fact that it shares the first pitch with the equally popular Prince of Darkness (5.10c), an early start is highly recommended.  There are many other options on this wall and in this area if this route is jammed.  Sour Mash is another good option on BV Wall and a few variations of DOTW exist also:  Yellow Brick Road is a 5.10b 2-pitch direct variation beginning on the third pitch, and The Gobbler is a 5.10a variation to the start.  To approach, follow the stream bed until a large wall blocks the way.  Here, you should be directly across from the large arch on the lower right side of the wall.  At this point, follow a faint "trail" up left to fourth class terrain and scramble up this, aiming for the left side of the arch.  Take the trail to a rocky terrace on the left of the arch.  Locate a nice right angling crack about a pitch up.  The bottom of this crack is the top of the first pitch.    P1:  Climb nebulous 5.6 terrain aiming for the bottom of the crack on P2.  Belay at 2 bolts about 100' up.  The pro on this pitch is somewhat sparse but the climbing is easier than anything else on the route.  P2:  5.9, ~160'  Make a few thin moves off the belay up and right and gain the crack.  There are lots of slabular moves on this pitch due to the angling nature.  The crack eats stoppers.  Follow this crack to another double-bolt belay.    P3:  5.9, 100'  Continue up the crack until a line of bolts leads to the right.  Continuing straight up puts you on Yellow Brick Road.  Check out the plaque.  Make the exciting traverse right clipping 4 or 5 bolts on your way.  This is steep here but the holds are big.  Once you gain the large crack, make some 5.8 offwidth moves up another 30' to another 2 bolt belay on your right.  If you miss the belay, which is hard to spot, another possible, albeit uncomfortable, belay can be had a little further up.  P4:  5.10a, 150'  Continue up the crack to it's top.  The crack becomes thinner and thinner until it's gone.  At the top, two strangely placed bolts mark the crux of the pitch and the climb.  Make a few very thin moves out left aiming for the bolted belay.  P5:  5.10a, Exciting pitch!  Follow the line of bolts up and left on tiny edges and belay at another set of bolts at the base of a cresent shaped corner.  P6:  5.9, 130'  Follow the cresent corner up and right.  It starts out shallow and easy and gets steeper and harder near its top.  Step onto the face and make some bolt-protected moves up and left to a thin crack.  Follow this bolted crack up to another bolted belay.  P7:  5.8, 120'  Follow the thin crack straight up.  Near the top, the angle rolls off and easy climbing leads to a large ledge with belay/rap bolts.  Most people rap from here as we did, although the route continues up for another 4 pitches which are suppose to be good.  For the descent from here, make a series of double-rope raps down the wall.  Staying a little left on POD is the best option if noone is coming up as there are fewer rope-eating cracks there, although rapping down DOWT and Yellow Brick Road works fine too.  We did it in 5 raps.

route_description: Approach as for Dream of Wild Turkeys, the first pitch is shared with this climb.  Prince of Darkness ascends straight up the center of Black Velvet Wall.  From the ground, 5.10 climbing seems improbable up this blank looking face.  Once on the rock, positive edges abound.  Pitch 1: 5.6 Start up the right facing shallow corners to the crack above.  Place some gear or solo to the anchors.  Pitch 2: 5.10b From the bolted anchors, climb straight up the face past many bolts.  Mostly positive edges with a few balancy moves and slopers.  End at the bolted anchors.  Pitch 3:  5.10a From the bolted anchors, climb straight up past even more bolts and positive edges, with a few pieces of gear in the crack down low.  End at the bolted anchors.  Pitch 4:  5.9 Similar to the previous 10a pitch, but slightly easier.  Pitch 5: 5.9 The climbing starts to become more slabby, with a few longer runouts between bolts.  This pitch ends at the belay for the final crux pitch.  Pitch 6: 5.10c The crux of the climb is right off the belay past the first 2 bolts.  The rock is remarkably different as the positive edges have given way to a slick slab with a thin, shallow crack.  Fire up the crack on thin holds and smears.  Be aware that it is difficult to the first bolt and it is possible to smack into your belayer if you fall.  Edges reappear and the climbing eases off to the final anchor at an excellent ledge, which is quite welcome because all of the previous belays have been hanging.  Descent: 2 ropes are required.  You can rap the route or the adjacent Yellow Brick Road.  It is also possible to finish up Dream of Wild Turkeys and walk off.  I overheard a local call the Prince of Darkness the "Prince of Footpain"  He was right on that accord.  The climbing isn't the most comfortable with the continuous edging, and all the hanging belays are tiring.  However, he also said the climbing wasn't that good and was monotonous.  I disagree, I think it is fabulously continuous, with great position and great protection.  The blank looking face offers a truly unique experience for a 5.10 climb.  Overall, I felt the climbing was of continuous difficulty after the first pitch, all in the 5.10- range.  I felt little difference in the grades of the various pitches until the crux moves.  The crux moves are definitely in your face.  Enjoy!

route_description: This route is a reasonably good Donelly climb and seems to be free more often than others.  It is just as long and good as 'Generic Crack,' but less generic.  The size changes throughout and the angle weaves back and forward, throug a few hanging corners and flaring pods.  Fing a long climb left of the ever-popular Chocolate corner area- continue left past Mr Peanut and toward Generic Crack to near the bolted arete of Let Er Buck. Just right of there (if memory serves- I just did it again on Easter of 04) is a splitter off of the ground with rounded edges. About 10M up is the first pod, which is also the crux.  A rack of cams should include a few down to an inch, with at least two each #2 and #3.5 and probably three each #2.5 and #3.  That should do well, but if you love plugging tons of gear, consider taking more.  Take a few slings too, as the pods protect deep in back.  A 70M rope will get you down, a 60 won't without trickery.

route_description: This route is after Elephant man and just before Dos Hermanos.  Only P1 is listed in any of the guide books and it goes at about 5.9.  The first pitch splits a big block and is relatively short - probably no more than 60'.  It ends at a ledge with nice Fixe anchor bolts.  Belay from this ledge even if you only want to do P1 and rap when you are done.   P2 is the business.  Leave the ledge on the crack to the right of the anchors.  Basically, the crack gets wider towards the top, but the first 3rd of it stays pretty much in the 1.5 Friend to 1.75 Friend size.  I hate these sizes.  I was able to chimney for part of the upper section, which is kind of a flaring slot with gear in the back.  My second, a little bit better of a climber than me, called the pitch 10+/11-.  This is what I though it was, but I'll err on the side of caution, since it was a seasonal warm-up.  The route only gets 2 stars because the top of P2 gets a little sandy.  Remember that 2 stars in the Creek is better than 3 stars at many other places.This pitch is no longer than 80' since I lowered from the anchors (through my own biners of course!) back to the ledge on 50m doubles.  The nice things about this route are that it is not the same move over and over, but is still a crack, and the hordes were too busy with nearby chocolate corner and all the others.

route_description: This is the climb to the left of Drain Pipe in the same alcove.  It is a bit longer, but we were able to do it with a 60 m rope with no problem.  We finished this climb on Thanksgiving Day just as the weather turned to hell.  Starting this climb was a grunt for me and I felt insecure.  However, my taller second was able to move through this section more securely.  As mentioned above, the start is wide and awkward. Once this section is surmounted, the climbing is more straightforward. This crack undulated a bit more than most IC crack and allowed for more size variety.  We felt this climb was for sure a solid 10 and maybe 10+.  Though most climbs that eat 1.5 Friends/.75 Camalots at the Creek tend to be harder, the presence of pods and some sections being slightly less than vertical kept it from being an 11.  Save a 3 Friend/2 Camalot or 2 for the top, which is probably the only place they'll fit anyway.

route_description: From the parking lot, go across the drainage and then past the first trail (to Generic Crack).  The next trail will take you up to the Chocolate Corner area.  Hike past Chocolate Corner to a large inset chimney with two routes inside.  This is the route on the right side of the chimney, ascending a slightly overhanging thin hands to finger crack in an acute dihedral/slot to a anchor composed of two drilled pins.  About 70 feet.  Start up the seemingly frictionless thin-hands slot (with occasionally tolerable hand jams) to a pod, where you can place the #3 Camalot and milk a "rest".  The 25 feet from the pod to the anchors is the crux, with acceptable and sometimes excellent fingerlocks. Hardmen and hardwomen will just jam straight up to the anchors, while the rest of us softies can use an inelegant combination of stemming and chimney technique to supplement the finger jams.Three stars anywhere else, but two stars at most for Indian Creek.

route_description: Its name gives good indication of what to expect.   The first pitch follows a nice hand crack to wide hands then fists. Belay at the fixed pin and nut on a nice ledge.   The second pitch immediately pulls a small roof to a fixed bong then out left under a long roof (crux) while underclinging an offwidth and sliding a #4 along. Don't leave gear in this roof because it will get sucked up into the crack. Now follow a chimney while arm barring a wide crack for balance. Climb up into the now obvious squeeze chimney and place a #2 up high. Drop back down to the ledge and squeeze through the chimney with your feet smearing behind you and your ass hanging out under the roof. Great exposure here. Move out around the corner on good jugs then up into a chimney. Save a #4 for the belay.  The third pitch climbs on the face up to an alcove where you move out around the corner to the right on dikes and up the runout face (easy, on big dikes) to a good ledge with good pro.   Pitch four follows a crack to another good ledge.   The fifth pitch is an easy dike hike much like the last pitch of Travelers. Some pro can be found, or run it out to the top. Lots of fun and one of the most exposed routes at the leap.   Really wide and kinda scary.

route_description: The Sequel is a great moderate climb that you won't have to wait in line for. It follows the huge left-facing corner just uphill from Braille Book. If Braille Book looks like a cluster, just keep walking. The Sequel starts off a big ledge that is accessed from above. Some bushwhacking is required on the final approach, so stash whatever you're not bringing on the climb out in the talus, before the going gets tough (or you'll end up doing the bushwhack thrice). Faster parties would do well to link this climb with another of the shorter routes on HCR, or a route on HCS.  The rock at this end of Higher Cathedral is exceptionally featured with diorite knobs. Unlike most chimney climbs in the Valley, you're not using pure oppositional force on glassy rock the whole way up. It's more like the chimney climbing in Red Rocks, where half the time you're just face climbing up one of the walls of the chimney. It's a pretty unique climb on very solid rock that's surprisingly clean given the lack of traffic. The climb receives morning shade, then a bit of sun in the late morning/high noon before the whole wall goes into the shade in the afternoon.  You can start by just climbing fun knobs on the wall outside the chimney. After 40ft or something, the features get smaller and you'll want to enter the chimney. Stem and chimney your way up for a full ropelength. There's a bit of 5.7-5.8 stuff towards the end of the pitch. Belay at a stance in the far back of the chimney. There are a few nuts behind a chockstone and you should back this up with a biggish cam (3-4") in the crack.  The second pitch climbs a steep and flared squeeze chimney (5.7). There's occasionally a good placement for nuts or small cams in the various cracks you'll find on one of the walls of the chimney. But if you want to really sew-it-up you'll need some 6" (or bigger) gear. At the top of the chimney climb out the right side to a ledge. You can set a belay here or continue up a fist crack off right and then up the face on big knobs. Belay at a large ledge.  The final pitch is shared with Braille Book and most other climbs in the vicinity. There are a variety of ways to go. My favorite is to scramble up and left, passing a triangle overhang on its left side, and then ascend straight up the remarkable headwall on bucket-sized knobs and flakes. Some of the most fun 5.4 jug-hauling you'll ever do.  To descend, follow cairns and a climbers trail south-west through brush, and then contour to the left, descending open slabs. This leads to a short 3rd/4th class gully (just two downclimbing "boulder problems") after which you will be back at the top of the Spires Gully.

route_description: This is a burley and sustained, mostly thin hands-to-wide crack system that offers plenty of fun and adventure.  Should be considered a must-do for the aspiring 5.10 offwidth climber, even though some of the harder sections were not necessarily offwidth.  This route is very overhanging, exposed, and basically wild!    Start with a steep chimney and go up. The second pitch is a sweet 3 to 4-inch hand and fist crack that seems to go on and on.  The 3rd pitch involves working up to a thin flake, making some wild moves up and right on it, then cruising thru some 5.10- thin hands, finishing with some squeeze to the belay on a chockstone. Another pitch of 5.10 fingers (we climbed the left of the two cracks) takes you to the crux 5th pitch.  This entails a pumpy undercling out a right-trending flake system.  This section felt like 10+ to me but I was pretty tired by then.... if you're feeling fresh maybe it's only 10a as listed in my '87 Meyers and Reid guidebook?

route_description: This ultra-classic, super-short finger-crack is quite a popular line at castle and seldom feels very easy. There's a good rest at the handjam pods high on the route. Some consider it cheating to reach out to the rail at any point that is not the very top of the horn. Also, watch out on warm days as the crack and the super-polished footholds can get very greasy. Technically the route continues up to a rap anchor and several more pitches to the top of Castle Rock, but this is rarely climbed. There is a route description for this in the Leavenworth guide.

route_description: Canary ascends from the right side of Logger's Ledge and reaches the top of Castle Rock in 2 pitches (3 may be necessary with a 50m rope).  A memorable line, Canary combines interesting climbing with terrific exposure.  Approximately 100 feet to the left of Saber, a short section of face climbing leads to a right facing dihedral and a broken crack system that reaches the left side of Saber ledge.  This is the start of Canary.  P1.  Begin by climbing approximately 15 feet of unprotected face to the base of a right facing dihedral.  This section is not trivial, but the holds are positive and it is no harder than 5.7.  Alternatively, it may be possible to begin in a small dihedral to the left and traverse right to gain the crack system at the top of the face.  From the top of the face, follow the dihedral and subsequent crack systems up with good gear.  Ascend until you are under the giant roof, then break right onto Saber ledge at the top of the crack system.  This pitch is the technical crux of the climb, culminating in the moves up and onto Saber Ledge (5.8).  Belay from gear or the giant eyebolts on the right of Saber Ledge.  P2.  From Saber ledge, contemplate what lies ahead.  The second pitch begins with instant exposure, and the airy step off Saber ledge may be the pyschological crux of the climb.  Begin by traversing obvious holds leading left and slightly up from Saber ledge.  Though intimidating, the traverse is easier than it looks, and giant holds await you on the arete.  It is possible to protect the traverse with a reasonable small alien on the face, otherwise it may be possible to place large gear (with long slings!) above Saber ledge before beginning.  Upon reaching the arete, climb past two bolts and follow your nose and your gear on increasingly easier climbing to the top of the formation.  Like many routes on upper Castle, the exact line is not obvious; expect some runouts on easier terrain. We were able to reach the summit with a 60m rope; a 50m would be somewhat short.  To descend, follow the trail off the back of the summit to Logger's Ledge.

route_description: Pitch 1 climbs through some funky wide stuff, 5.8. Has big bolted anchors.  Pitch 2 goes through a roof to a bolted ledge. Fun double-crack jamming up higher in the slot and sweet face climbing over the roof characterize this pitch.   Pitch 3 ends at a big ledge above.  Pitch 4 is a short pitch w/ chimney.  Pitch 5 reminded me of an upgraded version of the p3 finger crack on West Crack in Tuolumne.  Has bolted anchors at top.  One more pitch to the twelve o'clock ledge.  Pitch 6 reminded me of various sections on Crying Time Again in Tuolumne.   From the 12 o'clock ledge, you'll want to move the belay up onto the small ledge above you. There is a brush-filled ramp that heads up and right and then walk back left across the ledge to belay below a white flake.   Pitch 7 (variation going up West Tibetan Tower) is a long pitch of mostly 5.5 and 5.6 with some 5.7 moves up a corner. Anchor in less-than-great rock.   Pitch 8 up East Tibetan Tower is a 5.8 squeeze chimney. Somewhat hard to protect and stays tough for quite a ways. Eat your food, Tina.   Climb up the flake about 20 ft, place some gear and then make a cruxy traverse right. There is a slopey softball sized knob which I used as a handhold. You are aiming to get to the small corner/flake up and to the right. The first couple moves are the hardest (5.9) but it stays somewhat sustained in the 5.8-5.7 range higher up. Don't blow any of the moves or you will take an ugly swing back into the big flake below.   At the small corner you can get a solid .5" TCU. Climb straight up the face to another small left facing corner. The gear here is tricky (micro cams help) and the stances aren't very good for fiddling with gear. Climb to the top of the corner and then follow a dike up and left. From here you just wander up the face, taking advantage of the numerous knobs and features. There is no gear however, so don't blow it in the upper regions of the pitch or you will crater on the ledge 150' below. I found a way through that felt about 5.6, but there is potential to make it harder if you don't route-find correctly. Even at 5.6, it feels sort of "out there" as you pinch slopey knobs and smear your feet while looking at a death fall. The pitch ends at a ledge/ramp that diagonals up and to the left. Gear anchor.   From here, we got off-route for the next two pitches so I can only speculate at pitches 9 and 10. Pitch 9 looks like it wanders across the face up and right to belay beneath the big left-facing corner above. It also looks like another ass-puckering pitch of 5.9 face, like the previous one, or possibly even worse. Pitch 10 climbs the left facing corner, with probably some chimney climbing. The topo calls it 5.8 and it doesn't look bad. This will take you to War Lord Ledge.   The variation we did was actually quite nice and I recommend it. From the top of p8, wander up about 40ft of easy face climbing to a bolt. From here you follow a line of bolts along a dike that angles up and to the left. Probably 5.8. Some of the bolts are a bit rusted, but they're fat ones and the hangers are nice and fat too. Belay at a bolt anchor above the dike. Pitch 10 continues following the bolted dike with a section of 5.9 near the end. This will take you to War Lord Ledge. The dike (and bolts) continue on, and this is probably the best way to finish the climb, but we were pressed for time and decided to just finish up the moderate final pitches of Sands. But first a 5.0 pitch along War Lord Ledge is necessary to link up with the top of p10 of Sands.   Pitch 11 climbs up a left facing corner to a ledge. Traverse along the ledge to the right and then climb up the right side of a flake to a small ledge at the top of the flake. 5.5 maybe.   Pitch 12 follows the obvious dike above the ledge through the low angle and lichen covered face. There's no pro, but only the first couple moves are maybe 5.6, and then it turns to easy 5th/4th class. From the top of this pitch you can unrope and 3rd class it to the top of the dome.   If you walk over to the far left side of the ledge you will find some wrap anchors that drop you into silk road which you can wrap to the base of the route.  NEED 2 60 METER ROPES! Or you can stay on route through 5 more pitches of run out slab climbing. We climbed two more pitches up the right side of Tibetan towers which is found on the left side of 12 o'clock ledge.  The first pitch is easy 5.6 and second is dirty 5.8 chimney.  The top of the second is really dirty.  You will find wrap anchors for silk road at the top of Tibetan tower which you can take to the ground, or you can link back to the original route on war lord ledge which heads right.  One short single rope rap to the top of West Tibetan Tower and then four double rope raps to the start of the route IIRC.  Leave adequate time to find the rap anchors on War of the Walls, if that's the way you're descending. We ended up heading straight to them by pure luck, but there were times as we headed down the increasingly steep slabs that I was questioning if we were going the right way. It's not very obvious and the drop off below you gives the feeling that you're walking off the edge of a cliff.

P2 (C1) Aid through a stellar roof through a splitter crack with bomber C1 placements.  The crux of the route is probably cleaning this pitch, so be sure to read up on cleaning roofs BEFORE attempting (better yet, get some practice at your local area)! Continue past roof to a bolted anchor.  P3 (C2) A fairly long (150'?) pitch. Aid through second (smaller) roof and out onto arête. Straightforward nutting and good cam placements up this vertical crack, which ends on a nice ledge with bolted anchors.  P4 (5.7) Short section up easy 5.7 crack to top.

parent_url: /v/chimney-pond-south-basin---summer-rock-routes/111173512 
route_description: The Armadillo has just about everything you could hope for in an alpine climb: Chimney climbing, face climbing, crack climbing, ridge climbing, big time exposure, solitude on the route mixed with gawking, awed filled hikers at the top.    This route climbs at least 6 pitches of the huge pyramid and ridge in the middle of the south basin to the rim of the mountain, 10 minutes from Baxter Peak.  Expect to get an early start and plan for a long day.  The rangers will inspect your gear and require you to bring a #4 camelot, or equivalent cam.  You will need to fill out an itinerary form and leave the camp by 8 am.  The approach is long, and somewhat sketchy.  Rock hop around the right side of Chimney pond until you come to the stream bed on the south side (back.)  Follow the stream bed (which will have a lot of water after rain) south to the headwall of the basin, at the waterfall which makes up the start of the Ciley Barber route in winter.  Skirt the waterfall on the left (in the trees without a rope or via some easy but technical climbing through the rock band.)  Cross the stream at another headwall and follow loose wet slabs and vegitation up and to the right until you can access a narrow vegitated ledge which will lead left to the start of the climb.  There is a chock stone blocking convenient access on this ledge, which can easily be passed, however it is very exposed and ropping up before this point is safe and convenient.  Build an anchor below and to the right of the small flake with a pin.  Plan for at least 2 hours on the approach but it may take you 3.  Pitch 1, the chimney:  From the vegitated ledge clip an old pin on your left and boulder up to the next ledge system, move left to the base of the huge detached flake.  Stem, jam and wedge you way up the chimney behind the flake to the second comfortable ledge, about 2/3 of the way up the hige flake.  (5.5)  Pitch 2, the face: Climb on the fat arete of the flake for about 20 feet (protection can easily be found in the hand crack on the right.)  Move left just below an old pin (when you run out of comfortable feet) onto the face of the flake for some very exposed face climbing to the top of the flake.  (5.7 PG)  Pitch 3, the bad ass crack:  Climb straight up the splitter crack.  It starts as big hands and is easily protected with a #3 cam (keep sliding it up with you if you only have one.) Quickly pass a chock stone (red TCU) and climb up to the Bong.  Dump the #3 as the crack turns into fist and more and start to protect with a #4 cam (again, slide it up with you if you only have one.)  30 feet or so above the bong the crack widens to 6 inches for a few feet.  Soon the climbing eases up and protection can be had with a #9 and #10 nut as well as a #2 cam a little higher.  At the top of the crack belay with gear in the 1.5 in range behind a solid flake at a comfortable ledge.  Be careful of the loose rock at the top of this pitch. (5.7) WooHoo!  Pitch 4, the corners:  From here the quality of climbing changes character.  Access a ledge 15 feet above the crack and make progress through a few short diheadrals to the left seperated easy climbing and rest ledges.  Belay just beflow the crest of the ridge, or the spine of the Armadillo. Again, be careful of the loose rock(5.5)  Pitches 5 and 6, the ridge:  Climb the ridge to the top, which is basically 4th class hiking with a few 5th class moves.  Be careful as most of the rocks are pretty loose.  Many people simulclimb the last two pitches.    From the junction of the Armadillo with the knife edge trail you can hike to the summit (Baxter Peak) if you go right (northwest) and then down the Cathedral or Saddle trail.  The Saddle trail is much nicer to hike down with your rack and rope in your pack.  You can also go left and cross the knife edge and Pamola four/Chimney Peak and then down the Dudley trail.

The first two pitches are usually ice climbing at NEI2-3. These top out into a large bowl-like snow gulley that continues for the majority of the climb. Simul over some ice bulges and steep snow for a couple hundred of feet. The crux pitch is somewhere around what would be Pitch 9. This pitch can have wind-swept overhanging mushrooms of ice, but we were able to skirt around them. The last two or so pitches are cruiser snowy and rocky climbing.

parent_url: /v/1-whitney-gilman-area/107340303 
route_description: Whitney Gilman climbs the prominent ridge on the left side of Cannon. Interesting climbing, great belay ledges and incredible exposure make this climb a classic one. Edging up the well defined arete is an experience unique to New Hampshire climbing. There is no 5.7 more exposed than the WG.   The approach is long. Expect about one hour of hiking. Walk down along the bike trail until you reach a well marked trail (photo) heading into the woods. Follow this trail uphill (photo) and through the interminable talus field to the base of the climb.  The climb starts after a short scramble up and left from the base of the ridge.  Pitch 1: Climb a right facing corner until it is possible to move upwards on flakes and a wide crack. This is traditionally rated 5.4, but feels a bit harder, especially at the bottom. Most agree it's 5.6ish.   Pitch 2: Continue up near the right corner. A step down and right (5.7) is required to gain the prominent crack. Belay on the most convenient belay ledge.    Pitch 3: Climb the obvious hand crack in the steep wall. This crack is rated 5.8. There is an easier variation to the left, but there may have been rockfall on this part of the pitch. [Note: There has, but the climb is still there at 5.6-5.7. See description by "SP Boston" in COMMENTS, June 2014.]  Continue up the defined ridge. The exposure here is intense, as the malicious Black Dike looms to the right. Pass the famous pipe that was pounded into the crack on the second ascent, (What were they thinking?) and belay on an exposed, slanting perch. 5.7.  Pitch 4: Move up a steep wall, and then trend left on a slab to a comfortable belay ledge. 5.6.  Pitch 5: Many variations are possible on the last pitch. Staying right on the corner presents a better 5.8/9 alternative to the 5.7 groove to the left. Top out at a picturesque overlook.  Descent: Walk straight up into the woods on a well worn trail. The trail heads left and downhill. After a considerable amount of walking, you will reach the bike path. The trail does not go back to the base, so do not leave gear there.

route_description: The Gunks are not known for steep cracks, but there are some...    Start in the chimney of White Pillar and move out to the obvious crack when you can.  If you stem high enough you can start with hand jams; if you move out low, it's fingers.  Or you can avoid the chimney altogether for harder variations.

route_description: Vertigo is a classic (mostly) free route that offers sustained and varied climbing. A lead of the fearsome Half Moon Crack is a feather in a trad climber's cap.  Locate the undeniable splitter of Reppy's Crack and head to the right past a death gully. The next section of solid rock to the right holds Union Jack and Vertigo. Vertigo starts in the center of the low angled pane of granite at a wide crack.  Pitch 1, 5.6: Head up the wide crack to easier climbing. Belay on a comfortable ledge.  Pitch 2, 5.9 AO: A long 50 meter pitch. Climb up the slab to a roof. Skirt the roof on the right and climb up a beautiful cleaved flake to a mass of slings attached to a new bolt. Clip the bolt, lower down about 15 feet and pendulum or tension traverse right to a stance below a large left facing corner.   If you are using double ropes, it is useful to lead the first part of the pitch, including the pendulum, on one of the ropes and then use the other rope after swinging into the corner. This way, you will have little drag and your second will have an easier time cleaning the pendulum. It is still a good idea, however, to climb as high as possible in the corner before putting a piece in.  Once established in the corner, follow the amazing fingercrack in the left wall. The technical crux of the route is found here. This part reminds me of Serenity Crack in Yosemite- thin technical jams in lower angled rock. Finally, belay off two bolts at an awkward stance.  The pendulum section of this pitch was freed a few years ago by Tim Kemple at 5.12.  Pitch 3, 5.9: Make commiting moves right off the belay and then make a big span move to a crack out right. Follow this crack as it widens and goes through a bulge. Belay at a stance at the base of the unmistakable wide crack. This is a short pitch and can be combined with the next pitch.  Pitch 4, 5.9R: The Half Moon Crack. Routefinding is not an issue on this pitch: simply climb the wide crack. Pro can be placed at the start of the crack, but after that, there is no pro for the rest of the pitch since the crack is just too wide for gear. All goes swimmingly until the final few moves when the crack trends rightward and the angle steepens.   Do not underestimate this pitch. I did and scared myself silly at the top when I found myself desperately thrutching up the crack all the while contemplating a 60 foot fall onto the slab below. It's really a memorable lead.   Most climbers rap from the bolts atop The Half Moon Crack. Three double rope raps will get you down.

parent_name: Redgarden - Lumpe to the top 
parent_url: /v/redgarden---lumpe-to-the-top/105807704 
route_description: This is another excellent classic on Redgarden. Six pitches takes you to the summit of the  Middle Buttress via Rebuffat's Arete. Start at the base of the West Chimney below the Middle Buttress about 15 feet left of an alcove.  P1 is a steep start but only 5.6 up a nice crack (~110 feet). There are two cracks starting here.  The thinner crack on the right is The Great Zot (8+) and is one of my favorite 5.8s in Eldo.  Take your pick.  P2: Climb an easy pitch up to the Red Ledge arcing left. Look for a large eyebolt.  P3: Continue up the left-facing dihedral to a belay stance on the right (6).  P4: This is the crux and most exciting pitch. From the belay, traverse the hand crack left, pull around the arete, and continue up the steep and exposed hand crack.  Belay on a ledge to the left of where previously existed a large, detached block or the right.  Caution: this block fell down; this 6 foot high piece of rock used to rock back and forth if you pulled on it!  P5: Follow the crack to the R (5) or straight (8) up Rebuffat's Arete. The arete is recommended as it more spectacular.  Belay at a tree in the large V on the left.    P6: Find a clean, 5.5 crack to the summit.  This is a great short pitch also with a nice view and bomber gear.  DESCENT: Downclimb a notch to the North back to the West side of  Redgarden Wall.  The notch is beyond several towers to the NW.  If it doesn't look like easy 4th class, keep going.

route_description: Directissima is most commonly (if not always) done as a more difficult start to High Exposure.  It kicks up the difficulty a few grades, but it delivers a first pitch that is almost as classic as High E's final pitch.  1. Begin a little ways right of the original start of High Exposure, near the nose of the buttress.  Make a bouldery move up to a ramp and a leaning crack to a low roof, undercling around this roof and around the corner to the right (slick holds, some tricky gear).  Continue up the face to the obvious belay ledge on the right side of the High Exposure buttress.  A short pitch: 5.9, 60'.  2. From the left end of the ledge, traverse up and left, almost to the arete.  From here you have to perform a difficult long reach to a good hold (5.9+), which is well protected with fixed pins.  Belay at a perch just after the crux.  3. Easier climbing leads directly up the very exposed arete to the spacious area on the GT ledge.      It is possible to vary or combine the climbing to the GT in several ways, including: a) climbing straight up just after turning the major arete on P1 (a nudge harder and a bit more runout), b) belaying only at the perch past the P2 crux, or c) linking the entire pitch to the GT.    Finally: Continue up High Exposure's last pitch - how else would you finish a classic route?  Descend by the bolted rappel route right of the buttress (one rope will do).

route_description: The route starts with overhanging good hands crack , than thin hands, than off fingers. Just before crux when it become hard- there is the thin crack on the right which can be use for stemming. The crux for me is huge rich for good fingerlock just above small horizontal crack in the middle of the route. This section is similar in difficulty to Anticipation on Arch rock.  After the middle crux- route ease up to thin hands. The upper thin crux marked in book also 10d - felt at least two letters easier than first one. This route is my nemesis -I tried it 4 times and never redpointed.  I even know the pro in order , but it is not help. I've been always   trashed at the point to make  move on first crux

route_description: The route begins with a short approach pitch. It begins in a dihedral up about 40ft of decent rock.  After a few offwidth moves, step right and up a jagged hand crack to gain the good ledge.  This puts you at the base of the left-curving #5 sized beauty that is the essence of the climb.   The next 80 or so feet are glorious offwidth climbing.  Hand fist stacks and physical arm barring will help you gain ground.  Two small bulges will present some interesting "cruxes", but these are over quickly and it is really just a practice in persistence. There are several well-earned rests on the climb.    You pull out of the crack onto a small sloping ledge.  There is a nice horizontal crack to place mid-range cams for an anchor.  There are no bolts.  To descend we climbed another pitch, which is pretty awful to be honest.  Although the climbing was easy, the protection was questionable and the grunge was in abundance.  We were able to rap off a tree to the ground with 2 ropes.

parent_name: Capitol Peak 
parent_url: /v/capitol-peak/105746266 
route_description: This is the roughly 2.5-mile-long ridge that connects the Elk Range's two granite Fourteeners, Capitol and Snowmass. It's far and away the hardest 14er-connecting ridge in Colorado, and likely one of the hardest ridges in the state, for a variety of reasons -- length, exposure, route-finding, loose rock (extremely loose rock, almost the whole way).  To do this as a loop trip, park at the Snowmass Creek trailhead. (From the town of Snowmass on CO Hwy 82 drive south 1.7 miles to a T-junction. Turn left. Drive about 10.7 miles -- the road turns to dirt around 7 miles -- over a bridge spanning Snowmass Creek to another T-junction. Turn right and drive to the Snomass Creek Trailhead at the road's end.) Now climb Capitol via the Knife Edge (NE Ridge), approaching from West Snowmass Creek (go 1.7 miles up the Snomass Creek Trail to the West Snowmass Creek fork on the right, which is signed; head up this trail a good three-four steep miles until you can contour along the east side of Mount Daly, near then at timberline, into the basin northeast of K2 that contains Moon Lake -- this is a good place to fill water bottles).  From the summit of Capitol, descend SW along the knife-edge (loose, exposed) until you can downclimb due south into a bowl (some 5.7ish stuff, exposed). Continue south just west of the ridgeline on good, solid slabs, which lull you into thinking that the rest of the ridge will be bomber (it ain't). As soon as the slabs end, negotiate a series of gendarmes, invariably dropping west when the ridge itself either becomes too loose or impassable. This may involve 4th and 5th class downclimbing, depending on how far you drop off the ridge, and where. Continue this way for a long way, on terrain that is so sustained in its looseness as to be psychologically wearing. (I accidentally trundled some big stuff -- not onto myself -- it works best to keep your limbs as spread out as possible onto different blocks in case one goes. They all shift.) It also seemed best to stay right on the ridgeline when possible, as this places you atop all the choss.  Along the way you'll pass various notches that allow you to bail east into the Pierre Lake Cirque, from which you could drop back down to Snowmass Creek, and your car. You can also bail west at any point, but it would put you miles and miles from your car, with your best way out at that point being to negotiate a return northward to Capitol Creek.  Just before North Snowmass Mountain, after you've negotiated a prominent sub-peak, the ridge becomes an absolute nightmare, with car-sized teetering gendarms and huge scalloping flakes on the walls below them. Drop down west via a nasty downclimb (you could rappel, I think) to the talus below and walk south 50 yards until you're beneath a huge, rotten overhanging bowl in the ridge. Climb up diagonalling ramp/cracks to the right of the bowl on the north-facing wall (5.5, very exposed) to gain a faint rib. Follow dirt, loose blocks, etc. back to the ridge proper, then a nice pitch of solid rock (5.5/5.6; pass an old piton) on white stone takes you straight up the ridge to the summit of North Snowmass.   The agony is over ... cruise over to the summit of Snowmass (3rd class), then descend via the East Face route to Snowmass Lake. An 8-mile walk out on the Snowmass Creek trail takes you back to the car.  If you do this with a partner, stay at least 50 feet apart at all times. A rope would be useful for the occasional rappel; luckily, most of the 5th class terrain is on solid rock, but this is still a big, albeit spectacular, chossheap in the sky. Tread lightly ...  HISTORY: The first ascent of the North Ridge of Snowmass (maybe the most technical bit of the traverse; this is where I found the pins) goes to Paul Petzold and a group of Outward Bound students he was leading on July 3 or 4, 1963, according to Gary Neptune, who was one of Petzold's students that day. "Petzold was the chief climbing instructor at Outward Bound then and led the climb for a group of the better climbing students. He let me lead the second rope," Neptune wrote in an email. "There's a photo in the store of our little group on the summit after that climb. Maybe that was the first ascent of the ridge. There were no pitons other than the ones Paul placed, and I didn't remove any. I took a nice photo of the connecting ridge and thought that it might make a great traverse, but I never went back."   As for the FA of the integral ridge? Bill Forrest and Glen Denny set out, according to Forrest, with the goal to climb "from the Outward Bound camp above Marble to the summit of South Maroon,  then climb Snowmass, then on to the summit of Capitol, and then return to  the O.B. camp - in less than 24 hours." Part of their monster day, then, was to traverse from Snowmass to Capitol and, says Forrest, "we didn't stay on the ridge all the  way when we traversed from Snowmass to Capitol. Staying on the 'true ridge'  between Snowmass and Capitol was never part of the plan. We were pretty tired when we summited Snowmass. As I recall (and remember that was over 40 years ago), we were just below the ridge most of the way as we headed  west/northwest.  We had to gain the ridge to summit Capitol and  encountered a bit of 5th class as we climbed to the top of the ridge just S.  E. of Capitol's summit."  So for now, I don't know who made the FA going from Capitol to Snowmass or how closely that hove to the ridgecrest itself. One section, to me, looked so loose as to be impassable, but you never know...  Forrest and Denny's accomplishment in 1966 is truly remarkable, a feat rarely if ever repeated, I'd imagine. Says Forrest, "It was a long day in the hills. In short, we did the tour in under 24 hours, and my knees were badly damaged in the process. It was many years before I could walk without pain again."

route_description: While the guide quotes 8 pitches it can easily be condensed to 5 pitches. The cracks on this climb are stunning and very straight forward. There is quite a variety from low angle laybacking to hand cracks and eventually a chimney. A crux lies at the exit to a chimney where you get a bomber fist jam and have to work your feet up and get out of the top of the chimney. There is one bolted belay and all the rest are gear anchors. There are at least 2 good belay ledges.

parent_url: /v/j-crack-slab-area/106429253 
route_description: This is probably the most travelled route at Lumpy Ridge and one of the best finger cracks anywhere.  The crack, a backwards J, is barely visible on the right side of the Book as you hike in.  Follow the trail to the Book, bearing right at the end.  The route starts in a broken corner system just right of the clean flakes that mark Pear Buttress and Loose Ends.  P1 - Climb the easy corner to a good ledge, right of the bottom of the "J".  Alternatively, do the first pitch of Loose Ends and belay just below the standard ledge on that route.  P2 - Climb a short ways up a dihedral, then traverse left into the barely visible bottom of the J.  Climb the crack to a belay on lower-angle rock below a steep headwall (5.9, long pitch).  If you started on Loose Ends, then you'll traverse up right into the J past a piton and an old bolt.  This is said to be 5.10 and scary.  P3 - Many alternatives: a) Climb straight up the crack through the headwall at 5.11, b) Climb up and traverse across a slab (5.9) to the crack system on the left, then follow that to a belay, c) Climb up to the headwall, place pro, and traverse right to a ledge, and follow that back left to a belay.  The traverse can also be made lower on slightly better holds.  P4 - From "a" or "c", head up right to a break in the overhang, and climb through it to easy ground (5.7).  Alternatively, head up to the "cave" and chose an exit, Cheap Date being thematically the most compelling.

parent_url: /v/j-crack-slab-area/106429253 
route_description: One of my favorite 5.8s in the world. It begins roughly where the approach trail ends (take the right-hand branch just before the rock). The climb starts at a clean flake just right of a broken area.   P1. The flake can be climbed directly from the bottom (5.9 R), but the standard start is to climb up the slab right of the flake and step into it where it offers a perfect hand crack (5.7 w/ no pro for the first 20 feet). One can avoid all these scary starts (but also some great climbing) by scrambling up around to the left to get on top of the flake. In either case, from the top right side of the flake, follow thin cracks (crux) up to a belay on a sloping ledge.  P2. Follow the ledge up left to the edge of the face, then cut back right into a crack and follow that to a belay on a perfect small ledge (5.4). A much nicer way to do this pitch is to climb the left of two finger cracks (P2 of Loose Ends) off the initial ledge and then step left above; however, this is much harder than anything else on the route.  P3. Follow a perfect hand and finger crack above the belay for 100 feet (5.8), then traverse right under a small roof to a belay on another fine ledge.  There are a couple other ways to do the top part of this pitch. One can traverse along a horizontal break about 20 feet below the roof, then up and into the big Loose Ends corner where a 5.9- move leads to the belay ledge. Or, continue around the left side of the roof leading to some slightly runout 5.8 climbing and eventually easier ground where you can set a belay. I'm not as fond of this last option.   P4 & 5. Above the ledge, wander easily to the Cave area and pick an exit. Standard finishes are the Hurley Traverse or the Cave itself.

Pro is good, but at the top I would sink a good piece in and go for a small run out. The crack gets thin and less secure. 2 bolt belay.

There will be 2 pitons just before the move onto the 'True Horn' (crux).  The crack directly above with the pitons is a different route, and instead move to the right onto the horn.  Then up, up, and over to a good belay spot with a tree growing out of a crack.  If your second is not strong or is scared to move to the horn, make sure the rope is in the crack and not out away from it.  I know this sounds wrong, but if your 2nd falls they will be hanging in air and will be hard to get them back onto the rock.  P4 is long up a low angle slab to the top.   You can also start the climb with Coffin Nail (5.8) or On the Road (5.10c).  Also El Camino Real (5.10a) is another do way to go.

route_description: This three pitch beauty ascends a very obvious dihedral.  1) The first few moves off the deck are exciting and lead to an enjoyable first belay in a little nook.  2) The second pitch contains the business. You layback a 4" crack for 60+ feet to gain a belay either inside a little cave or right after depending on what gear you have left.  3) Pull the roof out of the alcove if that's where you set your belay, and continue up the dihedral in the left-side crack, much less steep and quite a bit easier than pitches 1 and 2. Eventually cross the slab and continue up to climb the deceptively easy roof on the right side. Top out and hike to the top of Tahquitz on easy 3rd class. Then you can hike out.
