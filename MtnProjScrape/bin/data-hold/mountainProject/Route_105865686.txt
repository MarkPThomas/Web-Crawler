route_description: This is the first climb that one comes to upon reaching the cliff.  It follows a crack that doesn't reach the ground. Do tricky slab moves up to the crack. Follow this crack (5.7) to a ledge.  A second pitch is rarely done for good reason. If you must try it, move left from the ledge and up a 5.9 crack.
