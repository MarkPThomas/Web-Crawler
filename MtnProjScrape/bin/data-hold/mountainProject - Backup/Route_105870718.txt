route_description: Knob Job is an excellent hand and finger crack that escapes midway up the route onto a series of wild knobs, hence the name.  Unique climbing for Yosemite.  Well protected. Climb the obvious hand crack until you gain a pair of thin cracks. Follow this through some knobs and trend to the left. Head for a tree that is far to the left of the start. Expect some rope drag at the top.  Long pitch.
