route_description: Pony Express is a great way to start the day.   The first pitch (5.8) is worthy of 3 stars, a lieback flake for a ways then it turns into a left-facing open book.    The second pitch only deserves 1 star... continue up from the belay on easy climbing for ~20 feet then use a wide crack in the gully to pull a bulge (5.9).  After the crux its 3rd class to the top.   Finding Pony Express is quite simple too.  It starts in the middle of a clean face on a very obvious flake - the only one in the vicinity.
