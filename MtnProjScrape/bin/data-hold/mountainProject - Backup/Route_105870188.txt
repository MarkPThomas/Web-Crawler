route_description: While it starts with a powerful, thin and technical finger crack, most of your time will be spent with the widening fist crack above.  For those with small hands, the upper section will be off-width, but for those with larger hands, enjoy!  The crux is right off the ground and pro is thin early on.  Watch you ankles falling right off the ground:  the base is littered with rocks.
