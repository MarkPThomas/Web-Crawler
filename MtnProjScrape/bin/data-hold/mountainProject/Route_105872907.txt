route_description: Ahab is a wide testpiece for the aspiring wide specialist.  Begin in a corner just to the right of Moby Dick.  After a short 20ft scramble you enter the meat of the climb, a chimney that narrows and squeezes all but the most petite out to the edge.  Exit out top of the chimney and enter a flaring handcrack.  Continue up another slot and then to the anchors.
