<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Approach</h2>
<br>
<font color="blue"><u>Butler Fork</u></font><br>
Drive about 8 miles up Big Cottonwood Canyon.  Just as Reynolds Flats comes into view, there will be a pullout on the north side of the road. This is the Butler Fork Trailhead. Park here and being hiking up the main trail.<br>
<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
The east face of Mt Raymond has many broad snow chutes bordered by prominent rock ribs. The existence of a clear runout below and an easy approach makes this a fine snowclimb.<br>
<br>
Take the Butler Fork trail. Make sure to take the west (left) drainage when the trail forks. Soon after this a saddle is reached, followed by a traverse across the base on Gobblers Knob along the Desolation Trail. This circumvents Mill A Basin.  <br>
Once you are below the series of rocky ribs, head up the chutes. The 2nd one from the left takes you directly up to the summit via a constantly 30 degree broad chute. The next chute right merges with this one, but with a steep constriction right before the merger.  The chute angles to the right and opens up.  From here, continue up to the main ridge and directly to the summit.<br>
<br>
I have only done this as a winter climb - it probably isn't very enjoyable without snow cover.<br>
<br>
If you are doing this route as a ski descent, take the East Ridge to the summit and choose any line down.<br>
<a name="chapter_4"></a><h2>Essential Gear</h2>
<br>
Bring snowshoes and an ice axe. Crampons might be needed at certain times of the year.<br>
<br>
This slope is avalanche prone and faces a dangerous aspect for the Wasatch Range.  Be sure to bring a shovel, probe, and beacon and know how to use them. Better yet, go when conditions are safe and know how to check the snowpack stability before attempting this route.<br>
