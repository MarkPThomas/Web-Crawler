<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Overview</h2>Mount Elbert has a lot to be proud of:   It is the highest mountain in Lake County, highest in Colorado, highest in the Rockies, and second highest in the contiguous United States.  But when you ask a non-climber or someone outside of Colorado, nobody has heard of it.  However, that’s their loss, because Mt. Elbert is a spectacular peak and worthy of recognition and respect from all.   One of the great things about Mt. Elbert is the relatively moderate terrain to the summit, allowing almost anyone with reasonable fitness to enjoy the mountain and its status.   <br>
<br>
Located in the Sawatch Range of the Colorado Rockies, Mt. Elbert was named for Samuel Elbert who was a controversial territorial governor of Colorado in 1873.   The first recorded summit of the peak was by H.W. Stuckle of the Haydon Survey in 1874.   Since that time, it has been climbed by thousands and even been summited by jeep.  <br>
<br>
In the seventies, there was a movement among a group of folks that felt Mt. Elbert's next door neighbor, Mt. Massive, was more deserving to be Colorado's highest peak. They stacked rocks in an attempt to raise the height of Massive's summit on top. Many more detractors would tear the summit cairn down upon their visits, so the attempt at changing Massive's elevation was eventually given up and Mt. Elbert has retained the title as the highest.  (Courtesy of <a href="http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl/user_id/2043">Aaron Johnson</a>).   Although most (or all) guidebooks list Mt. Elbert as 14,433 ft., a 2002 recalculation of old surveyed elevations, resulting in a world-wide adjustment of peak elevations, concluded that Mt. Elbert is actually 14,440 ft.   <a href="http://www.skyrunner.com/story/coheights.htm">Denver post article</a>. Despite this re-survey, most Colorado Climbers regularly use the old survey elevations. <br>
<br>
There are five main routes to the summit, the two most popular and easiest are the South Mt. Elbert Trail and the North Mt. Elbert Trail, both being well trodden class one trails.  These relatively easy paths to the summit are busy in the summer, attracting all types of hikers and climbers, young and old.   Like any high peak, weather, altitude, and personal ability must be considered before attempting Mt. Elbert.   But with a little preparation and planning, Mt. Elbert offers a wonderful climbing and outdoor experience.  <b>The most important thing to remember about climbing this mountain (or any other in Colorado) is to start early....like sunrise....to avoid dangerous afternoon storms.   If you see dark puffy clouds building, turn around and get off the mountain.</b><br>

</div>Mt. Elbert is located in central Colorado near the little town of Twin Lakes about 140 miles west of Denver, 50 miles south of Vail, and 40 miles east of Aspen.   The closest large town is Leadville, approximately 16 miles northeast.    <br>
<br>
The trailheads for routes are: South Mt. Elbert Trail Trailhead for the east ridge route, North Mt. Elbert Trail Trailhead for the northeast ridge, South Halfmoon Creek Trailhead for the northwest ridge,  Black Cloud Trailhead for southeast ridge, and Echo Canyon Trailhead for the southwest ridge route.    Please note the <a href="http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/photo_link.pl/p/photo_id__51659__object_id__634__type__user__mountain_id____route_id____user_id____order_by____limit__">below photo and route graphics</a> by <a href="http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=634">Kane</a> which shows several of the less common routes and variations of routes of Mt. Elbert.    The most popular and standard routes for Mt. Elbert are the South Mount Elbert Trail and the North Mount Elbert Trail as described below.<br>
<br>
<b>South Mt. Elbert Trailhead:</b> (9560 ft) From Leadville, drive south approximately 10 miles to the intersection of U.S. 24 and Colorado (CO) 82. From Buena Vista drive north 20 miles to the same intersection. Once on CO 82, drive west 4 miles to Lake County Road 24 (Do not confuse with U.S. 24). Turn right (north) on Lake County 24 and drive one mile to Lakeview Campground. The trailhead is on the northwest side of the campground and is also an access point for the Colorado/Continental Divide Trail in which a short section runs from Lakeview to the North Mt. Elbert Trailhead. Shortly after Lakeview Campground, turn left into an obvious parking area, overlook, and dirt road. High clearance vehicles can drive to 10,440 ft. by driving west past the parking lot on a rough road for 2 miles until the road ends and you see other vehicles parked. The upper trailhead is on the north side of the parking area. Cross a creek via a footbridge and continue a short distance until reaching a signed intersection of the Mt. Elbert/Colorado/Continental Divide Trail where you turn left.   See the left side bar or click here for the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/route/322285/south-mt-elbert-trail.html">South Mt. Elbert Trail</a>. <br>
<br>
<b>North Mt. Elbert Trailhead:</b> (10,050 ft.)   From Leadville, drive 3.5 miles south on U.S. 24 to Colorado (CO) 300.  Turn right (west) on CO 300 and drive .7 miles.    At .7 miles, turn left (south) on Lake County 11 which is a newly paved road.   Drive south 1.8 miles on Lake County 11 and turn right (west) at the signed intersection for Halfmoon Creek.   Continue southwest past the Halfmoon Creek Campground and the Elbert Creek Campground until reaching the signed North Mt. Elbert Trailhead at 6.9 miles.  Note:  This trailhead is also referred to as "South Colorado/Main Range Trailhead" in some guidebooks.  It is an access point for the Colorado/Continental Divide trail, a short section of which runs from here to the Lakeview Campground to the south.<br>
<br>
<b>South Halfmoon Creek Trailhead:</b> (10,240)    Follow directions to the North Mt. Elbert Trailhead except ﻿continue another 2.1 miles to the signed South Halfmoon Creek trailhead.  <br>
<br>
<b>Black Cloud Trailhead:</b> (9700 ft)     From the intersection of U.S. 24 and CO 82:   West on CO 82 for 10.5 miles to a right turn (north) to the signed trailhead.<br>
<br>
<b>Echo Canyon Trailhead:</b> (10,000 ft)   From the intersection of U.S. 24 and CO 82:   West on CO 82 for 12.5 miles to a right turn (north) where there is a cabin and a sign for Echo Canyon.<a name="chapter_4"></a><h2>Red Tape</h2>No permits or fees are required to park, climb, or hike.<br>

</div>
<br>
As with most Colorado high peaks, June through September is considered the summer climbing season.   However, Mt. Elbert is also climbed in the dead of winter by experienced mountaineers.   It is a popular ski mountaineering destination due to low avalanche danger on several of the routes.   Louis Dawson recommends using the South Mt. Elbert Trail and the North Mt. Elbert Trail for winter ascents.   Violent thunderstorms are a daily occurance in summer.    Plan to be off the summit or ridges by early afternoon to avoid lightning danger.   Start very early and allow 6-8 hours for climb and descent.<a name="chapter_6"></a><h2>Winter Climbing of Mt. Elbert</h2>
<div class="image-left" style="width: 506px;" align="center">
<a href="/view_object.php?object_id=373049"><img src="/images/medium/373049.jpg" alt="Elbert January 2008" style="width: 500px; height: 207.24346076458752px;"></a><br>
Winter alpenglow on Mount Elbert</div>Winter is a great time to climb Mt. Elbert.  Afternoon thunderstorms are not an issue, but winter brings an entire new set of conditions that must be considered.  The standard winter route is via the east ridge (South Mt. Elbert Trail) which begins at the overlook near Lakeview Campground.  The 4WD road to the upper trailhead is closed in winter.<br>
<br>
This is a great winter route because there is no avalanche danger if you stick to the route.   However, do not take the mountain lightly in winter.  Since the 4WD road is closed, this equates to an 11-mile round-trip climb.  Due to the distance, some climb Mt. Elbert in winter as an overnighter, with a camp either at the 4WD upper trailhead or on the shoulder in the conifer just below treeline.  But most still climb it in a one-day push....however, expect a LONG day.   The road to the upper 4WD trailhead is easy to follow and snowshoes will sometimes be needed.  Once at the upper trailhead, the route finding can be tricky because the trail cannot be seen (due to snow).   Once you reach the upper trailhead, cross the footbridge and head northeast past the ponds (on the right) until reaching <a href="http://www.jackieandalan.com/images/elberttrailhead.jpg">this sign</a> a short distance later.   Continue past the sign approximately 200 yards until coming to a second sign where you turn a hard left (northwest).   Climb northwest up the steep slope through the aspen forest.  With luck, you'll run into the switchbacks, but if not, the general rule is to head directly northwest until reaching the shoulder just below treeline.   Normally, previous hikers have created a "trench" in the snow to follow, but after a large fresh snowfall, the trench may not be evident.  Also, there are sometimes orange ribbons tied to trees to mark the winter route up through the apens.  Once on the shoulder, follow the standard route using the maps below.<br>
<br>
<u>Gear:</u>  Ice axe and crampons are generally not needed; however, conditions may dictate otherwise.   Normally, snowshoes are a <b>MUST</b> from the trailhead until reaching treeline, but sometimes they are needed all the way to the top depending on conditions and/or recent snow and winds.  Or....they may not be needed at all if the snow is hard packed.  The upper ridge above treeline is windswept and snowshoes are not generally needed.<a name="chapter_7"></a><h2>Camping and Lodging</h2> <div class="image-left" style="width: 506px;" align="center">

The Nordic Inn is highly recommended.    Further down highway 82, the <a href="http://www.vtinet.com/mtelbert/">Mt. Elbert Lodge</a>, B&amp;B and cabins, is within walking distance to two trailheads, Black Cloud and Echo Canyon.  <a href="http://www.leadvilleusa.com/">Leadville</a>, <a href="http://www.aspenalive.com">Aspen</a>, and <a href="http://www.fourteenernet.com/buenavista/">Buena Vista</a> offer the closest hotels, motels, and bed and breakfasts outside of Twin Lakes.   Aspen, to the west, also has lodging but is considerably more expensive.    There is a hostel in Leadville at 500 E. 7th which has $3.00 showers and rooms for $15.00/night.  (719) 486-9334.<a name="chapter_8"></a><h2>Mountain Conditions</h2>
<p>Most of the trails to the summit are well maintained and easy to follow.   In fact, in some sections above treeline, the trails have become multi-trails where people have started new ones to avoid the deep ruts of the old trails.   Try to avoid starting new trails and stick to the established path to minimize impact. Treeline is at approximately 12,000 ft; therefore, you have about 2400 ft of climbing in weather-exposed terrain. </p>

<td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 6px;">Thanks, I should have read that "a recent survey of several Colorado peaks, including Mt. Elbert, concluded that Mt. Elbert is actually 14,440 ft."<br><br>
<br><br>
By the way, who does these surveys?  Is it the USGS? Must be someone else cause the USGS site (see http://egsc.usgs.gov/isb/pubs/booklets/elvadist/elvadist.html#14,000) lists it at 14,433 ft, but that is a 1967 figure (from the National Geodetic Survey).  <br><br>

Sorry, I'm just very curious as to when and who did the most recent survey and came up with 14,440 ft.  </td>

It was just a recalculation of the old surveyed elevations and Elbert was not resurveyed.<br><br>
<br><br>
It's actually a world wide adjustment (some areas went up and some down) and not unique to Mount Elbert or Colorado.   It's actually a recalculation of the geoid:<br><br>

I guess there will be lots of different elevations floating around out there for a long time.  I haven't bothered changing all my SP pages to the new calculated elevations!   </td>

This re-calculation makes me wonder about the Borah Peak story - that it rose 7 feet after a 1983 earthquake.  Prehaps the National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1988 is responsible for the 7 foot rise more so than the earthquake.  Anyways…<br><br>
