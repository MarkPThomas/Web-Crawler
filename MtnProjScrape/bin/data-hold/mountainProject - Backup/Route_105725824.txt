route_description: On the far end of the northwest face, going from the ground to the ledge below the Overhang Bypass, there is a nice low-angle jamcrack. This is a good beginenr's lead and would take whatever protection you might want to jam into it. It's also a decent and fun entry-level solo. The climb starts just down from the "walk up" to the ledge and finishes at the base of the Overhang Bypass.
