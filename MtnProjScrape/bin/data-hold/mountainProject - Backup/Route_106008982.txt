route_description: Approach Time: 2-3 hours Descent Time: 2-3 hours Time to climb the route: 3-6 hours Sun Exposure: sunrise to late afternoon Height of route: ~500', length 1/2 mile to North Summit or 0.8 miles to the end.  Generally, people do the traverse from South to North. This is because the crest slopes upwards in that direction and therefore you will end up at a higher elevation. Doing it North to South would involve more downclimbing.  Probably best to Simul or Solo much of the route.  To rope up for every single pitch would take a horrendous amount of time.  Start the climb at the South face above a patch of pine trees and stay a bit left. The climbing is <5.6 here and climbs very textured / featured rock upwards onto the ridge. Follow the path of least resistance. Once on the crest itself, just follow it along. When in doubt, check out both sides of the crest and traverse along the easier one. The crux of the climb comes on the left side (West) of the crest directly below the South Summit. Strenuous and physical climbing up a good crack leads to easier climbing and then the summit. Sign the register.  From the South Summit: Do not rap, but rather climb back down the ridgetop for 100' and traverse past on easy ledges on the East side of the South Summit. Trying to rap often results in snagged ropes here. OR Simply continue the travers and downclimb the next section, placing pro for the follower.  From the North Summit: Many parties stop here and rappel off the crest (2 double length rappels on the West side). There are many rap stations that appear so bring some webbing in case the stations need new webbing.  Continuing the climb offers great climbing, but the climbing difficulty increases so it is recommended you be solid at the grade.  I'd say some of the downclimbing was 5.8.  Retreat: It is probably best to bail off the West side at just about any point.  There appear to be many rap stations at random intervals on the face.  Multiple short rappels are best.  Be prepared to leave slings and or gear.
