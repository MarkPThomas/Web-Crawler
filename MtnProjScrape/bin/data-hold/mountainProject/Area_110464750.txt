description: The Wonderland of Rocks is a roughly twelve square mile, wild and road-less area that is very complex and easy to get lost in hence it's nickname - "The Wanderland".  The area has been broken into two separate areas - Wonderland North and Wonderland South to make navigating this maze of rock easier and to mirror the two entirely different trailheads and approaches. 
getting_there: Please refer to the individual area, Wonderland North or Wonderland South for detailed approach information.
