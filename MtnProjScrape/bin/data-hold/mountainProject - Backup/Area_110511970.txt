description: The Sierra Nevada's Palisades are loved by California mountaineers for their wild alpine character, and a jagged ridge line featuring a concentration of some of the highest summits in the state. Some of the largest remaining glaciers of the range hide in north facing cwms. This is an area where some early technical leaps forward took place in the  history of California climbing. But looking out on it firsthand, you will feel ready to make some of your own!  Surprisingly the Palisades ridge runs east to west here, allow a small series of glaciers to form below the shaded north side of the ridge. They are remnants of the Little Ice Age and how much longer they will last is open to debate. 
getting_there: Eastern Approaches For the Eastside approaches, Big Pine is the nearest town with services, and most trips start there. From highway 395 in the center of town, take West Crocker Avenue west. It soon curves and is renamed Glacier Lodge Road.  Follow it 10 miles to a large free trailhead parking area (Upper Sage Flats) on the right, there is a toilet here.   Middle Palisade and Norman Clyde Peak are accessible from Finger Lake or thereabouts, this area is reached by hiking the South Fork of Big Pine Creek Trail, although parking is at Upper Sage Flat, it's a good strategy to drive your packs down to the end of the road.  Temple Crag, Mount Sill, North Pal and its glacier are accessible from the North Fork of Big Pine Creek, which starts at the sign by the parking area toilet and crosses the brushy slope above the road up and around to the right and eventually the first falls, then onwards. A very popular trail, early reservations are recommended.  Western Approaches For the western approaches Bishop is the nearest town with services. The Bishop Pass Trail is used to access Dusy and Palisade Basins, so you'll need to drive up to the South Lake Trailhead - this is a very popular trail so early reservations are recommended. Approaches from the west are extremely long and not used for climbing in this area.  Permits These can be obtained here. Or you can wait in line the morning of the hike, something which I have only done twice in 30 years.
