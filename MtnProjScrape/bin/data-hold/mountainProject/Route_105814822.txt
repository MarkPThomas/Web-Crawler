route_description: Rusty Cage is the "Indian Creek" splitter of Sedona.  This route climbs a sweet hands to large hands crack in a left facing corner for 70ft to a two bolt rap anchor.  To access the corner make a short traversing move past a drilled pin and into the crack.  This route is very hand size dependent.  For small hands it could be fists to ow.  For large hands it will probably feel like a ladder.
