The climate & landscape is extremely varied, from baking deserts, to tropical rainforests, to ice-covered alpine mountains.  The climbing is just as varied, offering every imaginable type of climbing, from bouldering to big wall climbing; deep water soloing to high altitude mountaineering.   Destinations for Alpinists include the Canadian Rockies of Alberta & British Columbia, or the towering volcanos of Mexico.  Trad climbers will enjoy the legendary sweeping granite of Squamish, or the remote towers of the forbidding Cirque of the Unclimbables.  Sport climbers might enjoy a warm winter vacation to the towering limestone walls of El Potrero Chico or the odd basalt of Panama, or cool summer destinations like Skaha.
