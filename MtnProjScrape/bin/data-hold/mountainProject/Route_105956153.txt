route_description: This crack climb is one of Arche's easiest climbs and a quick tick.  It has a short approach, a walk off, and is easy to find, and has good protection.  It's not the greatest climb on the planet, but it's worth a spin.  Combine it with the Doil (which starts where Nutcracker finishes), and you get another climb to experience.
