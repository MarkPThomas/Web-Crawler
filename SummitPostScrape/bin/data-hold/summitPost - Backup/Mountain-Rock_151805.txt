<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Overview</h2>Bald Mountain is the most popular peak in the Uinta Mountains.  It is also one of the most popular peaks in the state.  Bald Mountain also holds the distinction of being the only mountain in the entire Uinta chain that has a maintained trail to the summit.<br>
<br>
The Uinta Mountains are one of the few mountain ranges in North America that run east to west rather than north to south. Within the Uinta Mountains are about 2000 lakes, and some 900-1000 are full of trout. Along with the San Juans in Colorado, the Uintas have more contiguous area above timberline than any other area in the Continental United States. This is a beautiful area with many lakes, meadows, wildflowers, and some rugged peaks. <br>
<br>
This is one of the easiest peaks of this elevation in the state of Utah.  The rewards are great for doing this spectacular hike.  The trail to the summit offers the beginner hiker a taste of what it is like to stand on top of an alpine summit.<br>

<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Routes Overview</h2>From the Bald Mountain Trailhead, the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1991/object_id/2170"><b>Bald Mountain Trail</b></a> climbs 1250 feet in 1.75 miles. This is by far the easiest and most popular route to the mountain, and is probably used for  well over 99% of the ascents of the peak.<br>
<br>
There are several more challenging routes available.  The <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2501/object_id/2170"><b>Northwest Ridge from the Notch Mountain Trail</b></a> makes a good route.  Another good and challenging route is the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2500/object_id/2170"><b>Northwest Ridge from Pass Lake</b></a>.  Both of these routes have the added attraction of climbing the spectacular <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2169"><b>Reids Peak</b></a> in the same trip.<br>

<a name="chapter_5"></a><h2>Red Tape</h2>There is a $3 access fee for parking at the trailhead, or any other trailheads along Highway 150.<br>
<br>
<a name="chapter_6"></a><h2>When To Climb</h2>July though September is the normal season.  There will be snow on the trail in June.  Highway 150 is not open in winter, and it would be a multi day trip to climb Bald Mountain unless you have access to a snowmobile.<br>
