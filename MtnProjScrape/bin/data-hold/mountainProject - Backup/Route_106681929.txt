route_description: You can have two more pitches for Nabisco wall and leave big gear at the base of Waverley Wafer. P1 - straight-forward chimney - 5.9 - 50 feet bring you to a big ledge p2. start as 6"  relatively easy ow but  toward the end become a flare in which you can nor really squeeze if average size. Layback and use the groove on the left face. This is a crux - hard for 10a. In the crux you have to be right side in ( so if you started left side in you need to change to the end)
