area_name: Black Velvet Canyon Rock Climbing  
area_url: /v/black-velvet-canyon/105731948 
description: Black Velvet Canyon could well be called the crown jewel of Red Rocks.  The black, varnished rock is of the highest quality and its walls host a high concentration of excellent and longer trade routes.  With walls over 2,000 feet high, the canyon receives little sunlight and as such can be quite a bit cooler than other areas.  Area classics include Epinephrine (V 5.9, 12-18 pitches), Prince of Darkness (5.10c), Frogland (5.8), Triassic Sands (5.10c), Dream of Wild Turkeys (5.10a), Yellow Brick Road (5.10a), Refried Brains (5.9) and many others that I haven't yet climbed.  As expected, the classics tend to be crowded (especially Frogland, Prince of Darkness, and Epinephrine).  It is recommended to have an alternative in mind should there be a queue for your desired route.   Many routes require two ropes to rappel.  Camping is NOT permitted at the trailhead (parking area) and violators will be ticketed.  Legal camping can be found 2 miles east of the Visitor Center on Hwy 159 for $10 per night per site.  IMPORTANT: Waste bags are provided by the Las Vegas Climbers Liaison Council in order to reduce human waste issues at the crags and boulders.  Please feel free to take one, use as directed, and dispose of in any trash receptacle.  Please do not leave them lying around, and do not throw them in the toilets at the parking areas.  The project was funded primarily by the American Alpine Club's Cornerstone Conservation Grant, with additional funding from the Access Fund and Mountain Gear.  Please do your part to be a good steward of this amazing climbing area. 
getting_there: Unlike much of the Red Rocks area, Black Velvet Canyon is NOT accessed via the Scenic Loop Road.  Instead, from the Red Rock Canyon Campground (a.k.a. "13 Mile Campground"), drive southeast on Hwy 159.  At the intersection with Hwy 160 (gas station w/ good beer selection), turn right (west) for approximately 4.5 miles towards Pahrump.  Be on the lookout for a pullout and road on the right-hand (north) side.  There is a paved parking lot here (called the "Latenight Trailhead" by the mountain bike set) with rest rooms. Follow the dirt road north from the parking area.  After a mile or two the road makes a left turn (west) at a usually closed gate and ends at a parking area near the mouth of the canyon.  Although fairly bumpy, 2WD vehicles **should** be okay on this road.  Park and follow the well-defined trail from here.  Count on a half hour to 1 hour for approach.
