route_description: This is a good climb to warm up on if you plan on climbing other routes at Sentinel Creek.  The crux is a short finger section down low.  A good one to get on if you are just breaking into the grade.  Many people will top rope pitch one of Ying-Yang .10d after climbing Hari-Kiri.
