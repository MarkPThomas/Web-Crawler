route_description: Getting started may be the hardest part of this climb.  With an awkward move you can wedge your body up into a somewhat chimney move.  The first 60' is a combination of jamming in one of two cracks (effectively hugging the rock) until a small ledge with a tree.  Rap here or continue up another double crack system with a few laybacks and near chimney moves until you come to the true chimney.  A few easier moves and you are at a ledge with two old 1/4" bolts and a large flake to rap from.  Lancelot can also be TR'ed from here.  I may not make it sound too fun, but its certainly a fun deviation.
