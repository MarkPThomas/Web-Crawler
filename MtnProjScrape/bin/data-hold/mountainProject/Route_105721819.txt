route_description:   This striking climb is easily identified as the wide crack which splits the formation into two distinct (upper and lower) halves. It starts as a hand crack but quickly widens to give good wide crack practice...do it 3 or 4 times in a row after leading to simulate longer Valley routes...The rock is quite good and although short the climb is memorable.
