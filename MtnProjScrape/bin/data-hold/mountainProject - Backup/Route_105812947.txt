Start on top of the boulder pile right of Jackie, at a thin crack.    P1: The crux moves are right off the deck with pitons as gear.  Angle up and left to a left-facing flake and pull onto the face on the left.  Continue up fun face climbing to a roof with huge holds.  Belay at a bolt anchor. 5.7, 80'.  P2: Follow a dihedral on the left to the top of the cliff. 5.4, 60'.  Descent:  From the top, rappel from the bolted anchor (2015).  It's also possible to walk off via the Uberfall Descent.
