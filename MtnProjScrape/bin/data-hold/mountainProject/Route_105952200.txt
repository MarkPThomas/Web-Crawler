route_description: This is a good route in the middle of the Monolith's east face.  It has 2 starts.  You can go from down below and make it 11a or you can start above skipping the first 2 bolts.  If you don't go down into the subterranean bit, it goes at 10a or so.  Follow an appealing face with neat, embedded rocks protruding from the matrix.  Pass 7 or 9 bolts.  There is a runout bit near the top above the last bolt.
