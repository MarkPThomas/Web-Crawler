route_description: You haven't really climbed it unless you've gotten inside the chimney and done the "belly roll"!   P1: Climb the wide crack until it leans leftward and opens into a squeeze chimney. Dive in there and worm your way upward (your belayer will die laughing; make sure they don't have a camera) to easier ground. Continue up past a corner, and belay on the ledge. (5.4, 70ft.)  P2: Go up the short, right-facing corner, then up past a crack to the top. (5.2, 50ft.)  Descend via the Uberfall Descent - much quicker and less tangled than rapping.
