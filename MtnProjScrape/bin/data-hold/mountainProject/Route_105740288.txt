route_description: Approach as per Nice Little Crack.  This is the bolted face.  Tricky start over the 1st roof, leads to edges and fun climbing.  Midway you will find a bulge,  friction over this avoiding the foot crack to the left.  Finally, trick #3, pop over the top roof.  And there... the anchors?.
