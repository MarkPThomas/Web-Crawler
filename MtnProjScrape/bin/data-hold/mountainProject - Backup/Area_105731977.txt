area_name: Calico Basin Rock Climbing  
area_url: /v/calico-basin/105731977 
description: Calico Basin has a wide variety of short routes.  There is a mixture of trad and sport climbs.  Calico Basin is a residential area, so climbers should be careful to avoid disturbing the people who live there.  At the time of this writing (2005) there is a good deal of construction going on here, so be prepared to be adaptable as regards parking areas and approach walks. 
getting_there: Drive west on Charleston.  About 2 miles before you get to the main scenic loop road, there is a turnoff to the right for Calico Basin.  It is clearly marked. Please obey all parking signs. Fines for illegal parking are a hefty $275!
