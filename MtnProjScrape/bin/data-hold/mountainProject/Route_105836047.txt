route_description: P1. From the nice ledge at the start, go straight up (same as Hermaphrodite Flake), heading left just where the flake starts.  Belay just a little higher.  P2. This is the crux pitch and the most fun.  5.6-5.7 sustained lieback/finger crack climbing for almost 100 feet to a two bolt anchor.  Good pro most of the way.  Great.  P3. Slightly runout face climbing past a few bolts  to a two bolt anchor.  P4. More fun liebacking.  The angle is much lower here, but placing pro is slightly awkward.  Set up a belay after the crack runs out and the angle drops to 3rd class.
