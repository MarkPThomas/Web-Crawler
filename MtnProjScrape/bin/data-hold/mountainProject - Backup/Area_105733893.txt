area_name: Cragmont Park Rock Climbing  
area_url: /v/cragmont-park/105733893 
description: This small area is located in Berkeley a little ways from Indian Rock.   This area offers about a dozen climbs (5.6 - 5.11), primarily easier climbs that can be toproped. This would be a great place to bring beginners, as most climbs are not height dependant, and are fairly safe on toprope. The toughest route is sport, with 4 bolts. The routes are primarily shorter slab routes.   There are no access problems, and according to the signs you could actually have a barbeque here and a nice game of basketball on the court located above the climbing area in the main park.    All routes can be walked off.
