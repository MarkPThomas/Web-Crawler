description: The Old Woman boasts several fine lines including the notorious Double Cross (IMO, the hardest 5.7 in the Park), Dogleg (an awkward 5.8), Toe Jam, the crowd-pleasing Geronimo, and if you're up to it - Bearded Cabbage (5.10c) and Spider Line (5.11d).   
getting_there: From the bulletin board at Hidden Valley Campground, turn around and you are looking directly at the east face of The Old Woman.  The right-angling crack is Toe Jam / Spider.
