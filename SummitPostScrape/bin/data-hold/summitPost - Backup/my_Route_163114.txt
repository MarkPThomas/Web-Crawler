<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Approach</h2>
<br>
     <b>From SLC</b>:  Drive eastbound on I-80 up Parleys Canyon. The trailhead is at the first bridge crossing over the freeway just east of the quarry on the N side of Parleys Canyon (about 2 miles from the mouth of the canyon). Coming from this direction you can't reach the trailhead, so you must turn around. To do so take the first offramp after this (a little more than a mile farther), cross the freeway, and get back on heading Westbound. <br>
    Heading WB on I-80, take the first offramp, turn left and cross over the freeway on a narrow bridge. Park on a turnoff on the far side of the bridge. The road enters private property beyond this point.<br>

<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
<b>Distance:</b> 1.93 miles (1-way)<br>
<b>Total Elevation Gain:</b> 3,210' ft<br>
<b>Trail Steepness:</b> 1,600 ft/mile<br>
<br>
    The West Slopes and Church Fork routes are probably more enjoyable ways to the summit of Grandeur Pk. This route is best done if you want to do a new route on Granduer and/or enjoy Pharoahs Glen, which is very scenic. Also, for those into suffering, it is steeper on average than the West Slopes trail.<br>
<br>
<font color="red"><b>Note:</b></font> The beginning of the trail crosses private property. According to the backcountry sking map I referenced, hikers are allowed to cross it, although according to Joe Bullough, climbing on the crags bordering the property is not allowed. If one really wants to, the private property can be skirted w/ some bushwacking.<br>
<br>
    From the pullout, continue up the road to the right. Walk past the gate (if it is open) and around a switchback until you get to a road junction. Take a right and curve back around as you pass by a building. Pass the building on the south side heading east. You will see a dirt road climbing a hill in front of you. (If you don't want to pass near the building, you can reach the road by going left at the junction for a few hundred feet and scramble up the hillside).<br>
   The dirt road tops out on a flat area and from here a trail continues up Pharaohs Glen. The trail bypasses some cliffs to the left (class 2 scrambling) and winds its way up the canyon. At times it is hard to follow but there are red trail-markers at regular intervals.<br>
   Eventually you will cross the stream to the west side of the canyon, and then cross it again to the east (this second crossing is at a wierd cement platform. When I was there there was a pit with boulders in the middle of it, covered with a terra-cotta bowl).<br>
   After another few minutes, the terrain flattens and one has a clear view of a wide open run on the west side of the canyon, bordered by forest on the left and a rocky ridge on the right. From here on it is cross-country. Cross the stream and head up the clearing until the ridge is gained. This can be either a class 1 slog or a class 2 scramble. Follow the ridge until you meet up with the obvious West Slopes trail.<br>
   The final part of the route involves some moderate bushwacking, but there is a faint game trail a little right of the ridge that keeps it pretty light.<br>
<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Essential Gear</h2>
<br>
Sturdy boots, a pack, and tolerance for a little bushwacking. In winter the route is mostly windswept, so snowshoes probably aren't needed. The final 150 ft stretch before the West Slopes ascends a 32 degree slope w/ a NE aspect, so avalanching on this stretch could be possible. Use your judgement and bring a beacon, shovel, and probe if snow conditions are unstable.<br>
