description: Essentially the mountains between Piute Pass and Pine Creek. Easily accessible from the east, not so much from the west. The big mountain in this region is Mount Humphreys, it's visible from many parts of the Sierra and is one of the more difficult peaks, being just shy of 14,000 feet. Humphreys Basin is a high tundra like environment, with grass and small lakes, farther north the Pine Creek basin curiously has peaks west of the main crest which are higher. Royce Lakes is a magical spot, surrounded by multiple high peaks, desolate, lifeless and yet hauntingly beautiful. Merriam Peak has recently seen multiple long rock climbs established on its north buttress.  While Mount Humphreys is obvious from Highway 395, the peaks west of Pine Creek remain aloof and mysterious, even as you hike up the Pine Creek Pass Trail, they show their shapes reluctantly. From Royce Col however, their true grandeur is revealed, and even west of those lies the highly desirable peak; Seven Gables.  When hiking up to Granite Park one cannot help but be impressed by the rocky peaks and pinnacles to the west - there are sure to be some climbs over there just waiting to be discovered. 
getting_there: From Hwy 168 west out of Bishop, the North Lake Trailhead splits off right, after passing through Aspendell. Plenty of parking usually at North Lake - although Piute Pass is also very popular in the summer months. The Piute Pass trail leads into Humphreys Basin a good camp spot for climbs on the west side of Mount Humphreys.  Pine Creek Trailhead can be reach by driving west off Hwy 395 through Rovanna and up to a rugged parking area south of the Tungsten Mill. The trailhead accesses Pine Creek Pass, Royce Lakes and through Granite Park to Italy Pass, plus it's advisable to use this trail to access the peaks west of Merriam, Royce and Feather, like Seven Gables. An old road is followed until the Pine Creek Lake Basin is reached.  White Mountain Ranger Station in Bishop is a good spot to pick up your permit, if you're coming from the south.  Permits  For the eastern approaches are available here.
