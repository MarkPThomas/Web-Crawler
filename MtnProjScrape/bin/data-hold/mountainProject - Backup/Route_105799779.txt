route_description: A beautiful, short crack climb that is harder than it looks.  Sustained and fun.  Start just right of the Uberfall, on a boulder below an obvious right-leaning finger crack.  P1: Climb the crack and belay from a tree at the top.  5.7+, 50'.  Walk off to the left and downclimb Uberfall Descent.
