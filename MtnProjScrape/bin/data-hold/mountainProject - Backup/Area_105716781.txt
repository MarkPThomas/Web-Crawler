description: Located in the northern sector of Canyonlands National Park, this is one of the most breath-taking places on Earth.  Island in the Sky offers adventure climbing in its purest sense on some of the most impressive towers anywhere in the desert.  Add a long and involved drive on rough roads, strenous approaches, scary rappels, and sometimes rotten, hair-raising rock and you have an area that will humble even the crustiest of desert rats.  Climbing began in this otherwordly place in the early 60's with  names like Layton Kor and Huntley Ingalls.  Other noteworthy  ascents were also made in the 60's by Larry Dalke and the Horn  brothers.  The 70's brought Fred Beckey, Eric Bjornstad, Jim Dunn, Ed Webster, Steve Hong, and many more.  The 80's saw epic free ascents by Charlie Fowler, Chip Chace, Ken Sims, Webster,  Dreiman, Olevsky and others.  Standards of difficult and dangerous free climbing continue to be pushed in the area and many new lines await those with the ability and courage to try them.  The best times to go to Island in the Sky are Spring and Fall.  Beware of snow and ice on the road in the Spring - it's a big drop in places!  It is cold in the winter and very hot in the Summer, duh.  Plan on early starts for everything here and don't underestimate any route. The drive out is long and can be  difficult to follow in the dark.  Climbing in the Island is dangerous, so if you can not accept this fact do not go there.  Loose rock abounds and every route will have some suspect stone on it.  Wear a helmet if you enjoy the use of your brain.  Plan on replacing worn webbing on rappels, don't skimp, it's your ass out there.  Moab is the closest hospital.  This is a fragile environment and is a national park for  everyone's enjoyment, so please leave no trace.  Look for existing trails and stay in rocky washes whenever possible. National park rules apply here, so don't bring your dog and don't leave any new fixed gear unless it is an emergency.  Clean aid only, no hammers!!!   
getting_there: Arrive at Island in the Sky via the White Rim Jeep Trail (do not try this in a low-clearance car).  Head northwest out of Moab on  191, and turn left onto 313 after 9 miles.  Drive 22 miles to the junction with the Shafer Trail and the ranger station.  Follow the Shafer trail and descend for 4 miles to the White Rim trail.  Continue for another 13 miles passing the Airport Towers to Buck Canyon and Monster Tower.  Continue on for another 18 miles to reach Monument Basin.  Allow at least 3 hours to reach Monument Basin from the ranger station.  Buy a map but beware that Monster Tower, Washer Woman, and Sandcastle are incorrectly located on the map.  A guide book is a good idea.
