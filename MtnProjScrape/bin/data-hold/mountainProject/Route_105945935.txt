route_description: So very classic.  Work up the first 25' of easy wide climbing to the small ledge beneath the striking, flared squeeze chimney.  After another ~35' the chimney (5.8) will begin to pinch down to take fists, then cupped hands, and finally hands, all the while arching and steepening.  This is a wild and pumpy crux section that does not let up until you turn the flake at the top of the crack.  Pull over the small roof/step on good holds, hold down the pump and gun up a thin crack in a shallow dihedral for the chains. Either rap with two ropes, or rap on a single rope to the anchors above Cristina (down and climber's left), and rap again from here to the ground.  Run a couple of laps on the beginning lieback section of Cristina for a bonus.
