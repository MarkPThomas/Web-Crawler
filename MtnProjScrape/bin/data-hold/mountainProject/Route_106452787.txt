route_description: on the far right side of the cookie after the 5.13 crack route there is a chimney (5.8).  Start up this and continue up through a squeeze chimney (5.9) and belay at the bolts.  2nd pitch goes up a 5.4 no pro ramp to a unlikely corner.  This climbing is full value stemming, jamming, and chimney moves. Two more pitches bring you to the top.
