route_description: You can really climb all over the southest buttress.  You get the most climbing if you start at it's lowest point, in the middle.  Many people start up and to the right a little, which loses some vertical, and the first pitch over there isn't so good.  However you start, after 3 pitches, steadily increasing from 5.3 to 5.6, you'll probably be funneled into a chimney.  It can get crowded here, and a backpack can be a real pain.  Climb around to the left and it's smooth sailing however.  There are so many options, passing people is generally easy if you're competent at the grade, and there are usually people all over the face.  A spectacular climb not to be missed.
