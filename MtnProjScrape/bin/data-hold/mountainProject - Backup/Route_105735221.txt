Start on the flake at the arete, and work your way up to anintersting sidepull move 20 or so feet off the ground.There are a couple of variations to this route, by keepingthe good hand to the right of the sidepull off, this routeis probably a 5.11a.  By working without the reachy move tothe  dish on the left about 15 feet off the ground, thisroute is probably a 5.11d.
