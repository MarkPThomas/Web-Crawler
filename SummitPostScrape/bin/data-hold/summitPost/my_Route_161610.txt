<br>
Drive to Brighton Ski Resort at the top of Big Cottonwood Canyon. Use the Lake Mary Trailhead, which begins at the Brighton Ski Lodge.<br>
<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
Distance: 2.94 Miles<br>
Elevation Gain: 1,921'<br>
<br>
Follow the Lake Mary Trail 0.73 miles to the turnoff to Dog Lake. Take the turnoff. As you near Dog Lake, the trail will split - take the left fork. The trail will gradually ascend as it traverses across the Brighton Ski Resort. Slightly farther than 1.21 miles from Dog Lake the trail reaches the ridgeline at a cat-track linking the Snake Creek lift to the Great Western lift. This point is known as Snake Creek  Pass.<br>
<br>
There are two use trails leading to the summit from Snake Creek Pass.<br>
<br>
 For the longer route, follow the cat-track from Snake Creek Pass to the Great Western Lift. Where the track ends a use trail continues heading north. This trail winds up to the ridge, just north of the summit, and then follows the ridge-line to the summit. The final few hundred feet requires some easy boulder hopping. This route in total took me about an hour from the parking lot.<br>
For the shorter route, follow the cat-track from Snake Creek Pass towards the Great Western Lift. Just past the sign for the 'True Grit' ski run you will see the partially eroded beginning of a use trail. This trail switchbacks immediately up to and around the ridge line, and ascends the final 50 feet or so from the south east.<br>
