area_name: The Three Penguins Rock Climbing  
area_url: /v/the-three-penguins/105717122 
description: The Three Penguins has a well-deserved name, although as one of my partners pointed out from the summit, the shadow looks more like a camel.  It is the first formation you notice driving up into Arches after going through the gate. 
getting_there: Park just past it at an indefinate turnout on the left side of the road.  You can do a chossy pitch directly up to the base of the formation or you can scramble up slopes to the right and then traverse back left on ledges (fast and easy).
