<br>
Begin from the summit of <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3021">Basin Mountain</a>. <br>
<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
From the summit of Basin Mountain, head west, dropping a little to the north before heading right along the ridge.  Gendarmes along the ridge will create some route finding difficulties, with the need to bypass them around the north and south, but generally the route stays true to the ridge. There is never a need to get further than about 100' away from the ridge. If a bypassing route seems to go further away than that, then that is not the way to go. In general it is more common to drop to the north to bypass obstacles.<br>
<br>
The technical crux is a well protected chimney with a chockstone at the top, requiring some stretching to reach the footholds lower down. Most of the route has enough exposure to keep it thrilling, and the rock is very solid.<br>
<br>
As one nears the summit, scramble up the ledges just slightly north of the ridge until the summit is reached.<br>
