<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
The Dry Creek trail is a nice shaded trail that climbs out of the Alpine foothill suburbs, staying on the south side of Dry Creek. A nice creek and a beautiful waterfall are nice sites along the way. The higher one goes, the more rugged the trail gets. <br>
<br>
At one point the trail forks, with the right route being less well maintained (?? mi, 8,300ft). Go right. This trail heads towards the north cirque of Box Elder Pk, and at 9,800ft the trail turns south and circumvents the peak.  Stay on the trail until after it crosses over a very broad, flat ridge. <br>
<br>
Beyond the ridge one can really ascend anywhere along the open grassy south slopes of the peak. These slopes are covered with huge stepped grades carved into the hillside. These were built to control erosion and allow plant life to grow back after the devastating effects of overgrazing allowed by early settlers. Until mid-summer there are usually some tongues of avalanche debris in the drainages that can provide good snow climbs and the possibility of a glissade while the rest of the hillside is bare. The route up to the summit is straightforward, and if you're lucky, you'll encounters hordes of ladybugs or mountain goats.<br>
