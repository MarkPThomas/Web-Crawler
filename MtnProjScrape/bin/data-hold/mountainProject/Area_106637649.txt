description: Steve Canyon is formed by a series of rocks that are oriented in a north-south direction; numerous routes exist on both the east and west sides of the formation inside the canyon proper as well as on the outer faces of the canyon.  From the mouth of the canyon inwards are the following:  Left Side (E. Facing)   The Orc Wall             Tennis Shoe Block Super Roof Wall   Right side (W. Facing)     Sidewinder Rock - West Face   Grain Surgery Wall  Mud Wrestling Wall  Popular amongst those in the know, this can be a good place to escape the winds and even soak up the sun depending upon the time of day. A good balance of crack and face climbs exist here from 5.4 to 5.12b meaning something for just about everybody.   Some of the better routes here include Skinny Dip (5.7 R), Super Roof (5.9), Grain Surgery (5.10b), Sidewinder (5.10b), The Decompensator of Lhasa (5.10c), Diamondback (5.10c) and Jumping Jack Crack (5.11a).    
getting_there: Two of the popular approaches for getting into Steve Canyon are as follows:  Hidden Valley CG Approach - Starting from the large lot at Hidden Valley Campgound walk along the west face of the Old Woman using a well-worn trail which leads directly to the mouth of Steve Canyon proper. This approach takes about 5-10 minutes depending upon which portion of Steve Canyon you plan on visiting.     Park Boulevard Approach - Park in one of several paved turnouts along Park Blvd. a short distance to the north of the turn into the Hidden Valley CG parking lot and follow a marked trail east to the mouth of Steve Canyon. The west face of Sidewinder Rock and it's distinctive slanting dike system is a good landmark. This approach takes about 5-10 minutes depending upon which portion of Steve Canyon you plan on visiting.     It's also quite easy to access this area from The Outback proper by heading west along the north side of The Blob and then south past the east face of Sidewinder Rock, circling around the southern end of that formation to arrive at the mouth of Steve Canyon.
