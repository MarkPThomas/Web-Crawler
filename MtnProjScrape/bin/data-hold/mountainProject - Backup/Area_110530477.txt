description: Little Lakes Valley is another excellent high elevation starting point for day (and longer) excursions into the high Sierra. The road to the trailheads here takes one conveniently to 10,000 feet of elevation outside the snowy months, offering relatively easy access to Bear Creek Spire and neighboring alpine playgrounds. Lodges, campgrounds and trailhead parking lots offer accommodations for various levels of expense.  Mono Recesses are a series of hanging valleys west of Mono Pass, the further west you go the less visited they get. Recess Peak is located over Mono Pass, although not a climbing destination Pioneer Basin is a wonderful high and relatively remote area, one of the hallmark High Sierra scenic destinations.
