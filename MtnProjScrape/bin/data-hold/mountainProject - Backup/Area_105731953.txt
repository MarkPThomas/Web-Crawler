area_name: First Pullout Rock Climbing  
area_url: /v/first-pullout/105731953 
description: Lots of short routes with short approaches; mostly sport climbing.  IMPORTANT: Waste bags are provided by the Las Vegas Climbers Liaison Council in order to reduce human waste issues at the crags and boulders.  Please feel free to take one, use as directed, and dispose of in any trash receptacle.  Please do not leave them lying around, and do not throw them in the toilets at the parking areas.  The project was funded primarily by the American Alpine Club's Cornerstone Conservation Grant, with additional funding from the Access Fund and Mountain Gear.  Please do your part to be a good steward of this amazing climbing area. 
getting_there: Drive a little more than a mile up the scenic loop road and park at the (you guessed it) first pullout.  A trail leads down and across the small canyon.
