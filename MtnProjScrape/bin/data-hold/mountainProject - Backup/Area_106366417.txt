area_name: Scheelite Canyon / Pratt's Crack Gully Rock Climbing  
area_url: /v/scheelite-canyon--pratts-crack-gully/106366417 
description: The most obvious and popular side-canyon in Pine Creek.  This area offers the highest concentration of established quality routes and clean cracks including Chuck Pratt's title offwidth.  Other sub-areas found here are the Mustache Wall, Ministry Wall, and the Oser Wall.  Route development here has exploded in the last 5 years, and the potential for more is overwhelming.  This is the most common destination for visiting climbers. 
getting_there: Turn right off Pine Creek Rd. after 7.7 miles onto a dirt road across from the campground.  The road forks immediately- take the right side and drive up a couple hundred yards to the parking area.  Hike into the canyon.
