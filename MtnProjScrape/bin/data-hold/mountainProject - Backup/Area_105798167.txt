description: The Gunks (short for Shawangunks) is one of the premier climbing areas in the country.  Located near New Paltz, NY, the Gunks is about 85 miles from the NYC metropolitan area, making it a popular weekend destination.  The rock is quartz conglomerate, solid rock with horizontal rather than vertical cracks. Climbing at the Gunks is characterized by roofs, jugs, traverses, big air, and sometimes "sporty" pro.  The Gunks is famous for great one-to-three-pitch climbs of all levels of difficulty.  You'll find some of the best easy and moderate trad climbs in the country at the Gunks.  There are a few bolted climbs at the Gunks, but no sport climbs.    The ratings at the Gunks are stiff; beware of a climb with a "+" at the end of its rating.  Climbs like Thin Slabs / Thin Slabs Direct (5.7+), Something Interesting (5.7+), Modern Times (5.8+), Broken Sling (5.8+), Le Teton (5.9+), and Coexistence (5.10+) will seem like sandbags to many climbers.  Climbing overhanging rock, even with jugs, requires endurance and commitment.  Most climbers new to the Gunks drop down a few grades in their first leads to get a feel for the rock, the ratings, and to learn how to place pro in the horizontal cracks.  The best time to climb at the Gunks is during the fall: September and October are the prime climbing season.  Mid-October brings the fall colors to the area, and climbers will have to vie with "leaf peepers" for restaurants and places to stay in New Paltz.  Climbing in the spring is also popular, but tends to be wetter and more buggy.  Summer is hot and humid (don't miss the swimming hole), and winter offers a few climbable days. New Paltz weather forecast  The Gunks is one of the oldest climbing areas in the country.  Fritz Wiessner first climbed at the Gunks in 1935, and he and Hans Kraus put up many classic routes in the 1940s.  High Exposure, established in 1941, remains one of the most exposed and exciting 5.6 routes any climber will ever do, and should be on every visiting climber's tick list.  Most of the Gunks is part of the Mohonk Preserve, a land trust dedicated to preserving and protecting the northern Shawangunk Ridge.  Climbers must pay a $17 daily fee to climb at the Gunks, or else buy an annual pass for $90 (amounts as of 2011).  Stop at the Visitor's Center, on Rt. 44/55 just below the cliffs, for more information.
