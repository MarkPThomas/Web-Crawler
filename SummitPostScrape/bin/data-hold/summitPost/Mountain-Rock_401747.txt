<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Overview</h2>Preston Peak is one of several peaks along the Brighton Ridge overlooking Brighton Ski Resort. This peak is actually within Brighton Ski Area boundaries, and during the ski season Preston Peak is a very short walk from the top of the Snake Creek chair lift. <br>
<br>
This rather plain peak is flanked by Clayton Peak on it's north east (47°) aspect, and Pioneer ridge <i>(and Pioneer Peak)</i> on it's west (275°) aspect.  Climbing Preston Peak and both it's neighbors in one trip is recommended, since Preston is less than a mile <i>(as the crow flys)</i> from either. Preston Peak is unnamed on the USGS topographic maps, but maps of Brighton have it clearly named and labeled at 10,315 feet. <br>
<br>
The views, in every direction, make climbing this unpretentious peak worth the while. From its peak one can see east into the Heber Valley, south into American Fork Canyon <i>(home of mighty Mt. Timpanogos)</i>, north down Big Cottonwood canyon toward Salt Lake City, and west at Pioneer Peak, Sunset Peak, Mt. Tuscarora, and Mt. Wolverine. <br>

<br>
From the main lodge at Brighton, simply follow the Crest Express chair lift to its top, and then head east up Preston Peak.  Alternatively, for a less steep climb, follow the Snake Creek chair lift to its top and then head west to the peak.<br>

<a name="chapter_4"></a><h2>Red Tape</h2>When Brighton Ski Resort is closed, there shouldn't be any red tape.  However during the ski season, you may have to purchase a lift ticket if you wish to summit this peak.<a name="chapter_5"></a><h2>Camping</h2>There are many walk-in campgrounds in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Alternatively, free camping is permitted in the nearby Mt Olympus, Broads Fork Twin Peaks, or Lone Peak Wilderness areas as long as it is done at least 100 ft away from trails.<br>
