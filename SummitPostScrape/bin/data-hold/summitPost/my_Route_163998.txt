<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Approach</h2>
<br>
Begin from the Horton Lakes Trailhead described on the main page.<br>
<br>
From the gate, begin hiking along the old mining road as it switchbacks up into Horton Creek Canyon. Eventually the trail reaches some meadows, and then passes by some old mining equipment  before reaching Horton Lake. By this point the mining road has become a trail and beyond this the trail becomes more feint and cross-country travel begins.<br>
<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
Continue up the canyon on the north side of the river until the Upper Horton Lakes are reached. Ascend the southern side of the east ridge from Horton Lakes. Once you are within about 100' from the end of the cirque you will see a chute on the extreme right-hand side of the east face.  Ascend this moderately loose chute until it dead-ends into a wall. From here traverse left and drop into another chute. Take this chute all the way to the top, where you will end up on the summit plateau, just a short ways north from the summit.<br>
