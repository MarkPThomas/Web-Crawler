route_description: This large, clean, right-facing dihedral is to the left of the start to Traitor Horn, and just left of On the Road.  Pitch 1 starts with third class scrambling, followed by 5.3 crack climbing.  The long second pitch has strenuous hand jamming near the start, an easy finger crack above, and then a crux move over an overhang.  The climb finishes on Jensens Jaunt.
