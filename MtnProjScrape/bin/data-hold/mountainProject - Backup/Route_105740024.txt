route_description: Keep walking uphill from Crescent Crack past Mexican Crack until you see two chimneys and a couple of bolted routes.  To the left of the chimneys is a 60' finger and thin hand crack - this is it.    Climb a few feet up an easy chimney, and then climb the steep but bomber thin hands crack over a small bulge.  Mostly 5.8 with a couple of harder moves.  There are chains at the top, or better yet continue up Hand Jive.
