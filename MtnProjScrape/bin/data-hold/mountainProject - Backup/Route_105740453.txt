route_description: At the base of Five Finger Wall, to the left of the "five fingers" is a large pine tree with a 3rd class scramble below it.  Get to this pine tree.  It then climbs up the relatively easy slab-corner system to the big chimney.  Climb the right wall of the chimney using the crack.  Fun hand and fist jams, and easy footwork.
