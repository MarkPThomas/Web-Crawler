route_description: This pitch is a fun and somewhat physical option for those who reach the top of Reed's Direct p2 and still want more - but not quite as much as Reed's 3rd pitch offers.    Fire up steep double cracks at the back of a shallow 'chimney' to pull onto a sloping ledge.  These cracks will alternately take knees, fists, armbars, and handstacks - the shallow chimney provides infinite no hands rests with the right body language.  Before you turn right onto the sloping ledge, gaze at the continuation of the left crack: a hard looking and overhung offwidth.      From the sloping ledge follow the nice crack as it curves up to a roof, which is easily pulled on the featured granite that abounds here.  A great pitch if you're looking for relatively tame, well protected, and non-sustained semi-wide climbing.
