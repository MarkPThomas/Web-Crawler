<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Want to climb El Cap?</h2>But you can't climb 5.12 and don't own a portaledge. Have no fear you can climb looking up at the big stone. Pine Line is for you. A short, but fun little crack leads up to a pine that you can rap off of, or top rope from.  <br>
<br>
<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>The Route</h2>Make your way from the triangle in the road at the 120 and 140 intersection to the  base of El Cap, below the start of the Nose. It's on the left side of the base of a buttress that is not very distinct. On the right side of the buttress is a fourth class walk up to the start of the Nose 75' above. Look for a small pine right above the point of this prow. Work 100' around to the left and find the big ledge that leads to the up to the base of the climb. The ledge is not obvious until you are starting up it, it's hard to see from the ledge from below. There is one obvious piton scarred crack. Climb with fingers in the piton scars. It is a bit hard to set pro because the scars are all flaring. It takes 3 or 4 small cams. There are a few much harder lines right along side, so you can use Pine Line to set up a top rope and work on the harder ones. Or just keep going up, the right side walk up and Pine line come together just above the pine, if you are all fired up, you should finish the nose in one to seven days. See the pic for a look at the crack and pine from where you get to the base of El Cap. <br>

Pro &amp; Anchors <br>
<br>
 The entire route can be led with nuts, and I actually found it easier to find nut placements than cams. Offset nuts fit very well in the bottom of the flaring pin scars.<br>
<br>
For the anchor, make sure to bring material for making a LONG extension to the anchor (about 10-15 ft). <br>
