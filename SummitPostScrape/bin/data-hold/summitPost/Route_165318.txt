<i>This is a 3700'+/- ascent day. </i> From the parking lot, cross the bridge and obtain the Cory-Edith Trial to your right.  Hike 6 km along the Cory Pass trail to Cory Pass, which means you will take a left at a fork in the trail and ascend a steep meadow area (some of the best bird watching in Banff NP).    <br>

<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
Ascend Edith on your right from the col.    You have a north angled chimney to ascend and descend going to the north summit, an easy scramble to the middle with one short exposed section, a fun short glissade over to the col between the middle and south summit (where you make your final descent), and the <b>most challenging obstacle, (when full of snow) the tunnel to the south summit</b> which can make for some tight and slightly exposed climbing.  <br>
<br>
The south peak is the most difficult of the three.  The route begins just below the center-south peak col in a north facing gully.  Scramble up steep rock in the gully  for about 8 m toward a narrow tunnel.  The tunnel can be a challenge.   Once through the tunnel, work your way across ledges to the south and intersect the south ridge.  <br>
<br>
On descent, return to the center-south col and descend back to the Cory Pass Trail.  Avoid down slopping slabs.<br>
<br>
You have great views of Mount Louis and the Gmoser route up that mountain (great route!).  You are awarded a good view of Cory to the west as well, another common scramble.  <br>
