route_description: This route is pretty darn good, especially if you like off-widths.  Approach up talus and across a ledge system from the right of the formation.  Head around the base to the left - this is the first crack system in a dihedral you come to.  The first pitch of the route basically starts at fingers and works its way to fists - the crux being getting over the obvious bulge.  Belay at fixed anchors 2/3 the way up the tower.  The last third of the tower is a delightful struggle up a flaring off-width - the definite crux of the route.  "Chimney" is a misnomer for this thing, the only thing I could squeeze in there were chicken wings and knees.  Two ropes gets you completely off the route, but it looked feasible to do it in two, single rope rappels.
