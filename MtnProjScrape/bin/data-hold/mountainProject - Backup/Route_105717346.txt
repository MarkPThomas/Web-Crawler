route_description: Classic moderate climb.  Very popular.  Starts in a right facing corner next to the neon sign that says "Binou's" (actually just pecked into the rock - probably by Indians).  Jam the crack until it gets tiny and a nice wide crack opens on the left, take a nice rest on a great knee jam, and scoot on up to the top.
