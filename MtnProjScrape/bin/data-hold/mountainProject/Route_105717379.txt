route_description: Begin on the southwest side (the parking lot side) and follow a 5.7 crack/face up about 25 feet to a flake.  Place a #4 cam here if needed.  Move up and a little right to gain the right end of the large, obvious flake splitting the tower just beneath the summit overhang.  Use a long runner to sling a horn here, then proceed straight up on overhanging jugs to a 2 bolt/1 drilled pin anchor.  Mantle (yeah...).  The rock quality is good, and can be trusted for the most part.
