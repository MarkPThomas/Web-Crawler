<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Overview</h2>Sunset Peak, one of the most accessible summits in the Wasatch, is one of several peaks along the ridgeline that terminates Big Cottonwood Canyon. This peak, while small, is very picturesque, offering fantastic views of the Brighton Ski area, as well as Little Cottonwood Canyon and Alta's Albion Basin and American Fork Canyon. The open slopes are great for easily accessible backcountry skiing. This peak is also along the Brighton Ridge Run route and abuts Point Supreme and Catherine Pass, which have nice side trails and views themselves. <br>
       During the summer, the peak can be climbed via some vague use trails that follow the ridgeline from Brighton's Crest Express lift to Sunrise Peak. More commonly, the peak is hiked via a maintained trail that begins in Alta (Catherine Pass Trailhead).<br>

<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Red Tape</h2>None.  Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood Canyon occasionally close due to avalanche dangers, but this is only during and immediately following some large snow storms.<br>
If you are approaching from Little Cottonwood Canyon, you can park free in the Alta Ski lot, which is about 2 miles from the trailhead.
