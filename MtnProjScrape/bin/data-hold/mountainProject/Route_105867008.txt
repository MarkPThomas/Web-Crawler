route_description: This very popular route lies in the farthest left book.   The Reid guide shows it as three pitches, but it's great to do it in two with a 60 meter rope. There are three trees on the route. Climb to the third tree, make a hard left, 10' to the corner. There's a nice little ledge there where you can sit and belay. Another long pitch goes to the top.  Descend by walking off a long ways to the left.
