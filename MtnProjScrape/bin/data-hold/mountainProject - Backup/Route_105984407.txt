route_description: This classic alpine route follows a long, airy quartz and basalt ridge with a couple of knife edge sections and towers.  In warmer weather this is an easy scramble/rockclimb, but with snow and ice it becomes a more challenging alpine climb.  Start early as the route gets a lot of sun. Trend right after the largest tower (above Suicide Couloir) to avoid some loose slabs out left.  A good view of the route can be seen from the Alta parking lot.
