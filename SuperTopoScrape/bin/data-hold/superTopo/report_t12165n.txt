<b><u>July 27, 2013 - The Approach</u></b><br>
As the dust settled and we emerged from our transport vessel, curious natives approached us one by one, to greet us and inquire as to how we could have made it here in one piece. With the looks we got, and the repetitious approach, license plate inspection, greet, and inquiry that each hiker did, one at a time during the hour we spent packing, I felt a bit as if we were aliens who had just arrived from outer space.<br>

<b><i>Signs of travel.</i></b><br>
<br>
Of course we weren't. Just two Utahns eager to climb. The poor weather forecast for the Bugaboos got me and Alec to change our plans, and stop by Gimli Peak in the Valhalla Range on our way to our main objective on our long trip out from Salt Lake City. The final drive was reputed to be a rough dirt road, that was maybe passable in a Subaru. We didn't have a Subaru, nor 4WD, but no one said that was required. However, due to cut funding for Provincial Parks in British Columbia, the road has gotten into much worse shape since the travel information had been written. Fortunately, we were driving Alec's car, and he has had some wild times driving it through a lot of rugged desert country. We nearly bottomed out twice, but barely made it to the trailhead thanks to Alec's bold and skillful driving. Everyone else at the trailhead was in a truck, SUV, or some other high clearance or 4WD vehicle, so naturally they ventured over to investigate this unexpected vehicle and where it was from!<br>

<b><i>The three summit of Mt Prestley towering above the dirt road on the way to Gimli. The dirt road is fine here but gets very bad near the end.</i></b><br>
<br>
The trailhead was surprisingly crowded for such an out-of-the way place, with German tourists, a large group of French Canadians from Quebec, and a variety of other travelers. Fortunately most of the crowd was either coming out, or only doing the class 3 scramble up Gimli. There was one other party vying for our route, but in the end they joined their friends on the class 3 and we had this classic line all to ourselves!<br>

<b><i>Alec and his car ready to go. The wire mesh is to keep rubber-eating porcupines from getting in and eating the tires! I think our mesh extends high enough to keep bears out, too. </i></b><br>
<br>
I was attracted to this route after first seeing <a href="http://www.stephabegg.com/home/tripreports/britishcolumbia/gimli" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Steph Abegg's TR on her website</a>, and later seeing <a href="http://www.ericandlucie.com/Gimli/Gimli.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Eric &amp; Lucie's account on their website</a>. Its inclusion in lists such as <a href="http://lamountaineers.org/NAC/browserf/other/climlist/clindex.htm" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">North American Classic Climbs</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beckeys-Favorite-North-American-Climbs/dp/0980122716/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1376800047&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=fred+beckey%27s+100+favorite+north+american+climbs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Fred Beckey's 100 Favorite North American Climbs</a> further reinforced for me the idea that this place was well worth visiting, even though it was out of the way of most other international climbing destinations in BC, and few other climbing friends of mine had heard of it (Alec included). I am very glad that we made this detour! The scenery was beautiful, the campsite was wonderful, mountain goats plentiful and friendly, and the climbing was excellent. Although it can be climbed car-to-car reasonable enough, the bivy at the base is so nice that I'd say it would be a shame to do it this way unless you are pressed for time. There is even a toilet and food storage lockers, so there is no need to worry about packing in or out extra gear like a bear canister or wag bags. We hiked in the evening we arrived, then did the climb, descended, and drove to Revelstoke the following day.<br>
<br>
The South Ridge was originally rated 5.8, but has since been re-rated in some sources to 5.10, with the big roof seeming to be the most commonly considered crux of the route. I felt like a section on P1 was harder, and the topo in Beckey's book shows this lower crux at a comparable rating. The lower crux was more committing and physical, but straightforward on the moves, while the upper crux is intimidating and requires some thinking, but it can be well protected and is only a couple of moves, although height can play a big role in how hard those moves are. Still, compared to climbs I have done in Yosemite, the High Sierra, and Southern Utah, I'd say 5.10 is a generous rating for the route. It really is more like 5.9- to 5.9+, so solid 5.9 leaders shouldn't be discouraged from getting on this one.<br>
<br>
The route itself is surprisingly steep for being mostly 5.7, and it is like this due to all of the horizontal dike bands. It reminds me of an alpine version of some of the climbing classics at Lover's Leap.<br>

<br>
The trail is steep, but easy hiking, with about 2,500 ft of gain in 2.37mi. Backpacking in for the night, we made it up there in 1 hour and 20 minutes of hard hiking. The terrain was just right for making the pace and exertion like that of a good aerobic workout, similar to some of the bike rides I like to do.<br>

Just to warn you all, the mountain goats here are plentiful and VERY friendly. They seem to leave your food well enough alone, but if you give any indication that you might be urinating, they will descend upon you like a pack of piranhas! It is difficult not to pee on them. One also followed me over to the toilet and stood on top of the rock behind, peering right down at me a few feet away - some privacy, please?<br>

We had a leisurely start as we were camped only 15 minutes from the base of the climb. We enjoyed breakfast and started the first pitch at 8:20 am. It took us 4:40 to climb the 7 pitches and scramble to the summit, and about an hour to descend. We would have been faster on climbing time, but lost a lot of time working out a stuck rope problem on the big roof pitch.<br>
