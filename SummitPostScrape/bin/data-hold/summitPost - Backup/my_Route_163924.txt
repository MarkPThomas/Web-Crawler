<font color="blue"><u>Albion Basin/Cecret Lake TH</u></font><br>
Take the 6200 South exit (exit #6) off I-215 and follow highway 190 south-east approximately 2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road. Continue straight through the stoplight and follow the road another 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where an electronic billboard on the right provides current road and/or weather conditions. <br>
<br>
Continue east up Little Cottonwood Canyon approximately 9 miles past the billboard to the eastern end of the Alta ski area. The pavement ends at a well maintained dirt road, which can be followed approximately 3 miles to the Albion Basin Secret Lake trailhead.<br>

Take the 6200 South exit (exit #6) off I-215 and follow highway 190 south-east approximately 2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road. Continue straight through the stoplight and follow the road another 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where an electronic billboard on the right provides current road and/or weather conditions. <br>
<br>
Drive about 2/3 of the way up Little Cottonwood Canyon, approximately 30 min from Salt Lake City. There are signs marking the turnoff on the south side of the road for the trailhead parking lot. <br>

<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>The Bullion Divide is one of the classic Wasatch ridgeruns. In its entirety the Bullion Divide route tops <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3430">Sugarloaf Pk</a>, <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/3428">Mt Baldy</a>, <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/mountain/rock/191302/hidden-peak-utah.html">Hidden Peak</a>, the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2103">American Fork Twin Pks</a>, <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2103">Red Top</a>, <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2353">Red Baldy</a>, and <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2209">White Baldy</a>.<br>
<br>
It has many variations depending on how much of the ridge you want to do.  Because the route is a ridgerun one does not arrive at the same TH that one had departed. Because of this, a car shuttle needs to be set up. The more ambitious hiker will begin at the White Pine TH for more elevation gain, but the route is mostly done from E-W from the Cecret Lake TH. Because of this, the route will be described heading E-W.<br>
<br>
<font color="blue"><u>Cecret Lake TH - Sugarloaf Pk</u></font><br>
<b>Distance:</b> 1.37 mi<br>
<b>Elevation Change:</b> +1,641'   -0'<br>
Take the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4109/object_id/3430">East Ridge</a> route to the summit of Sugarloaf Pk. This is steep but follows a maintained trail to Cecret Lake and then a well-defined use-trail to the saddle between Sugarloaf Pk &amp; Devil's Castle. (cl. 1-2)<br>
<br>
<font color="blue"><u>Sugarloaf Pk - Mt Baldy</u></font><br>
<b>Distance:</b> 0.76 mi<br>
<b>Elevation Change:</b> +513'  -465'<br>
Descend the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4109/object_id/3430">North Ridge</a> of Sugarloaf Pk to a saddle. This route goes through some brush on the west side of Sugarloaf Pk as it descends base-ball size scree. Once at the saddle, hike along the beginnings of a ridge to the NE of a ski lift coming out of Mineral Basin. A use-trail becomes apparent. Ascend this trail to the summit. (cl. 2)<br>
<br>
<font color="blue"><u>Mt Baldy - Hidden Pk</u></font><br>
<b>Distance:</b> 0.7 mi<br>
<b>Elevation Change:</b> +341'  -376'<br>
Head down the SW side of Mt Baldy. When the saddle is reached, either use the cat-track roads or stay on a use-trail that keeps to the ridge. Hike up to the Snowbird Tram atop "not-so-hidden" Hidden Pk. <br>
<a href="http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/user_link.pl?user_id=19993"><small><i>Ammon</i></small></a> <small><i>adds:"Also, just because hidden peak has a pay phone and running water on it doesn't mean it doesn't deserve to have a mountain page (hehehe...) "</i></small><br>
<br>
<font color="blue"><u>Hidden Pk - American Fork Twin Pks</u></font><br>
<b>Distance:</b> 1.13 mi<br>
<b>Elevation Change:</b> +843'  -392'<br>
Descend the cat-track on the west side of Hidden Pk.  Eventually this cat-track splits at a rocky ridge. The left fork heads into Mineral Basin. The right fork heads into Gad Valley. Take neither road, but head straight up a use-trail that follows the spine of this ridge. This becomes the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/mountains/route_link.pl?route_id=4502&amp;route_name=Northeast+Ridge&amp;mountain_name=American+Fork+Twin+Peaks&amp;object_id=2103&amp;option=3&amp;x=21&amp;y=5">North East Ridge</a> route.  Some fun and mildy exposed scrambling is encountered (cl. 3) before the prominent ridge is absorbed into the east side of the American Fork Twin Pks. From there, it is just a talus slog to the shorter eastern summit and a stroll to the higher western summit.<br>
<br>
<font color="blue"><u>American Fork Twin Pks - Red Top</u></font><br>
<b>Distance:</b> 0.29 mi<br>
<b>Elevation Change:</b> +140'  -219'<br>
From the summit of the American Fork Twins it is just a hop and a skip on some talus to reach the summit of Red Top (aka. Red Stack)(cl. 1-2).<br>
<br>
<font color="blue"><u>Red Top - Red Baldy</u></font><br>
<b>Distance:</b> 0.89 mi<br>
<b>Elevation Change:</b> +518'  -780'<br>
Descend the West Ridge of Red Top (cl. 1-2) to the saddle and ascend the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2232/object_id/2353">East Ridge</a> of Red Baldy (cl. 3).  This takes you over a small buttress to the south and then up a nice but loose scramble up a knife-edge ridge to the summit.<br>
<br>
<font color="blue"><u>Red Baldy - White Baldy</u></font><br>
<b>Distance:</b> 1.08 mi<br>
<b>Elevation Change:</b> +657'  -510'<br>
Head over the shorter west summit of Red Baldy and descend the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2231/object_id/2353">West Ridge</a> (cl. 2).  The red quartzite rock gives way to granite blocks as one nears White Baldy. Ascend the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2278/object_id/2209">East Ridge</a> (cl. 3) to the summit.  The route begins as a class 2 scramble on large granite blocks, initially on the north side of the ridge and then dropping to the south side. The final portion of the ridge to the summit is a solid class 3 scramble.<br>
<br>
<font color="blue"><u>White Baldy - White Pine TH</u></font><br>
<b>Distance:</b> 4.55 mi<br>
<b>Elevation Change:</b> +20'  -3,648'<br>
Scramble along the ridge to the lower west summit. The rock becomes more loose here.  Descend the <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/2041/object_id/2209">North West Ridge</a>. This ridge is very tedious, filled with large blocks that require constant detours (cl. 2-3).  Once the large gendarms are reached, either drop to the south to perservere to meet up with the route up the Pfeifferhorn, or declare that you've had enough for the day and drop directly to Upper Red Pine Lake. Head down the canyon. If one makes sure to stay to the east (right) of Red Pine Lake, the maintained trail will be found. From there it is an easy hike down to the trailhead.<br>

For Cecret Lake TH - Sugarloaf Pk it should be the east ridge, and for Sugarloaf Pk - Mt Baldy it should be the North ridge.

<td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 6px;">Hey man - I saw what you said about adding Hidden Peak on SP - I know that it is not really a destination for climbers/hikers, but I wanted to post a mountain page and get some power points. besides, it has some interesting history, and it gives me the opportunity to plug some of the other great mountains in the area. also, almost all of the peaks in the wasatch already have pages dedicated to them. <br><br>
<br><br>
anyways, you have some great stuff on SP, i enjoy reading your TRs and all that.  Peace.</td>
