description: The Coffin Buttress is home to one of the finest finger cracks in Little Cottonwood Canyon, The Coffin (5.9).  Also, a couple of bolted routes run up the slabs and a very difficult crack splits the Coffin Roof (5.12). 
getting_there: Park in the Little Cottonwood lower canyon Park and Ride. Locate the climber's access trail in the lot's northeast corner (directly north of the restroom). Follow this trail east until you are directly below the obvious shaped Coffin Buttress.  The most enjoyable way to get to The Coffin is to first climb Crescent Crack (5.7, 2 pitches) on the Crescent Crack Buttress.  This lands you right at the base of the rock.  Another alternative is to climb a steep trail that leads to the base, to the right of the Crescent Crack Buttress approach trail.
