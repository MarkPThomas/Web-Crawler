route_description: Five and Dime is the classic and namesake climb for this crag.  It is a strenuous crack that takes a wide ranges of gear, from small to off hands. The crux revolves around a strange pod midway up, followed by difficult finger locks and finishes with a burly hand to large-hand sized crack.  The gear is solid throughout, and if you are solid too then you should do well on this one.
