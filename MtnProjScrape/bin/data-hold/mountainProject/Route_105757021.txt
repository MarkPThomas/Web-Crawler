route_description: This route is located about 2 minutes from the parking lot and is next to Easy Jam.  Follow a trail around to the left of the Nautilus until a dihedral is found (Easy Jam) with a beautiful finger crack curving up and to the right.  Climb the finger crack and belay at a shelf 30-40 feet up.  A walkoff can be found by going to the right, squeezing through a small hole, and descending a easy chimney.
