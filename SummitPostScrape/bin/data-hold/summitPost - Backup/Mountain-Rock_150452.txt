<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Overview</h2>Boundary Peak is at the Northern end of the White Mountains and would not be climbed much except for the fact it is the highest point in Nevada, although it is not the highest peak in the area. It is part of a twin peak with <a href="http://www.summitpost.com/show/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/2540">Montgomery Peak</a>. Montgomery Peak is 200 feet higher but is located in California. Boundary Peak derives its name from the proximity to the boundary between the two states that runs down the saddle between the two peaks and was likely named by surveyors who were working in the West in the mid 1800s. The actual boundary between the two states was finally legally settled in 1980. The controversy stemmed from a survey done in 1873 by Alexey VonSchmidt. His survey placed placed the border from Lake Tahoe to the Colorado River askew with that established by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey between 1893 and 1899, putting Boundary Peak in California. If the USGS had not changed the border, <a href="http://www.summitpost.com/mountains/mountain_link.pl/mountain_id/5">Wheeler Peak </a> in Great Basin National Park, would be Nevada's high point. Many still consider Wheeler a more spectacular peak, I'll leave that to you.<br>
<br>
Most people who climb this peak are doing so trying to gain another in their quest to gain the high point in as many states as possible. The most climbed route, Trail Canyon, is a strenuous walk up through a tremendous amount of scree with some minor scrambling near the summit. <br>

<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Getting There</h2>No matter what direction one is coming from, you must get to Nevada Highway 264. About 200 yards south of the junction of Nevada Highway 264 and Nevada Highway 773 is a rough dirt road heading west. A 4-wheel drive is not required, but a high clearance vehicle is recommended, especially for the last mile or so. There are also a couple of small streams/washes to be crossed. Follow this road for approximately 14.7 miles to the trail head. At 2 miles continue straight at a cross road and again at 2.4 miles. At about 11 miles you will come upon the B &amp; B Mine, here you will turn right and the quickly left. Going straight instead of the right will take you to a parking area, two rights take you to the mines buildings. At mile 12.1 there is another road junction but plainly signed. Proceed up the canyon which is a right hand turn. At about 13 miles you will pass a small reservoir and possibly some fishermen. Here the road narrows and gets quite rough.<br>
<br>
Some people do use the Queen Canyon Road off U.S. Highway 6 just east of the California - Nevada border. It is a very rough road but passable to the Queen Mine at 9200 feet.<br>

<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Red Tape</h2>There are no wilderness permits required for passage into or camping in the Boundary Peak Wilderness. There is a sign-in / sign-out log in a wood box on a post at the trailhead. If you plan on camping, a campfire permit is required. This can be aquired via:<br>
<br>
Inyo National Forest<br>
White Mountain Ranger District<br>
798 N. Main St.<br>
Bishop, CA  95314<br>
(760) 873 - 2500<br>
<a name="chapter_4"></a><h2>When To Climb</h2>The usual climbing season is June through October once the snow is gone. It can be a nice snow climb (some say a better and easier one) earlier in the year.<br>

<a name="chapter_5"></a><h2>Camping</h2>Some people camp at the small reservoir along the road. Some have camped at the trail head. One can also camp up in Trail Canyon, but there are very few level places to place a tent.. Be sure to bring plenty of water as this is a desert. The only water is a small stream with a spring up Trail Canyon but there are also alot of cows grazing, drinking the water and doing their thing in it, so be sure to treat any water from this spring / stream.<br>
<a name="chapter_6"></a><h2>Mountain Conditions</h2>For current conditions call the White Mountain Ranger District Office at (760) 873 - 2500<br>
<a name="chapter_7"></a><h2>Ancient Bristlecone Pines</h2>There is a nice bristlecone pine forest on the northslopes of the East Ridge of Boundary Peak maybe a mile southwest of the trailhead. Coming back via the East Ridge allows one to descend through this forest on the way back to the car.<br>

<td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 6px;">The description of the access to trail canyon is accurate.<br><br><br>We took the East Ridge route, when taking this route you will need to do some side-hilling to avoid giving back altitude, so resist the urge to run the ridge. There was some snow above the false summit and reports from a day earlier said that post holing was a problem, we found good snow well past noon but it was well below freezing at the camp the night before.<br><br><br>Believe it or not there was NO WIND on the summit, a glorious day.<br><br><br>Descended the standard route, the scree had allot of medium sized boulders which precluded making good time.<br><br><br>DO NOT expect any services within 50 miles of this peak.<br><br><br>

<td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 6px;">Note: There is another water tank on the left and dirt road on the right 6 miles from Benton. We drove in at night and upon seeing the tank just opposite of this road, we mistakenly turned off Hwy 6 too soon. There is a wire gate that does not state to Keep Out, as you might expect on a private road. Do not be confused by this road. Mark your odometer and be sure to take the correct road 9 miles from Benton, as stated in the route description. We took the wrong road for about 2 miles and were miffed at how rough it was. Queen Canyon Mine Road is quite gentle comparatively speaking.</td>

<td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 6px;">Climbed Boundary Peak in about a half day on August 3, 2008. Only ran into one other person who summited and a few others who got lost and were looking for the trail up. For anyone reading this who hasn't done this peak, when you make your way up the gulch you want to aim at the low saddle on the right. Myself and the other climbers that day spent a good portion of the way back trying to find the correct trail for the ascent but had little luck. Basically when you get out of the hedges and your about to enter the sage brush (I built a rock pile at this location), turn right and follow the creek bed to the saddle. When you get close the saddle there will be a faint trail on the left hand slope, marked by little pieces of ribbons. Take the left slope and traverse to the saddle (you will find the left slope has much firmer ground than the right). Once you reach the saddle your golden, there is a pretty obvious trail that heads off to the left and follows the ridge line to the summit. On the way back you can shortcut the descent by taking the saddle over the drainage that flows into the sage brush field (a word of caution, this can be a little hard on the ankles since the slope is so loose).<br><br>
Hope this helps.</td>

<td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 6px;">As of 6-25-10 the road up to the "real" TH is much improved over what it was before.  However, one should probably scout it out on foot to assess your chances of driving without ripping your tires to shreds on sharp rocks before just driving up.  Such a scouting trip on foot would only take 25 minutes or so.</td>

<td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 6px;">Drove the road on 9/2/12. The road from Hwy 6 to the Queen Mine has deteriorated a little over the last few years and would be more difficult with a low-clearance passenger car, but could be done with very careful and slow driving (someone made it in a fairly low clearance vehicle while I was out there but I wouldn't have wanted to be driving that vehicle). The road from Queen Mine to Kennedy Saddle (Also known as Queen Mine Saddle) is in better shape than it was a few years ago when I last drove it and easy to drive in a stock Toyota Tacoma with 4WD. It might be do-able with high-clearance 2WD except that one tight turn might create a bit of a problem trying to get going again or backing up to negotiate the turn. So, if you have a truck with 4WD keep on driving up to the saddle and save yourself the extra walking.</td>

<td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 6px;">We drove (well, tried to drive) the road from US 6 to Queen Mine on 23 Aug 2013 in a Hyundai Elantra passenger car. We made it a good part of the way up, but it was a pretty rough drive, and we didn't make it all the way to to mine. We scraped the underside of the car pretty well in a few places, too.<br><br>

I guess I'm just saying that even though someone made it in a Camry, that doesn't mean that you should count on making it to the mine in a passenger car.</td>

Yes, the road sucks and you have to give it some gas especially in one steep place before the sharp turn. Coming down was kinda sporty too making that sharp left turn and going not to ride he scree to the valley.<br><br>
If anyone has a pickup or 4wd they should be able to make it to the mine at least. There was a small import of some kind that a girl and guy drove up with really low clearance.<br><br>

<td colspan="2" style="padding-top: 6px;">Queen mine road is passable to the mine at about 9400' as of 12/14/2013 via highway 6. I was in a Ford Explorer and had no problems getting to the mine. Attempted to get to the saddle but there was too much snow to drive safely. Hike was awesome, started at 230am with a full moon, light wind and about 10 degrees. Trail had about 5-6 inches of snow. Don't be fooled, the hike only gets harder as you keep going. The last 0.5 mile is nothing but large boulders covered in black ice, very tricky. It was very difficult to get around them and find the route to the summit. Scree was not bad at all, I am thinking probably because it was frozen in place. Had a great time and would rate the hike as intermediate. Make sure you have good solid boots and hiking poles. </td>
