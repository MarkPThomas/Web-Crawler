area_name: Elephant Butte Rock Climbing  
area_url: /v/elephant-butte/105957116 
description: I believe this is the high point of Arches Nat. Park, at 5,653 feet.  I doubt if this butte gets climbed too often, but for high point seekers, it's a good adventure.   
getting_there: I believe you start at the Garden of Eden Parking lot ( Same as for Owl Rock), but the butte is over by the windows area...down the road a piece.
