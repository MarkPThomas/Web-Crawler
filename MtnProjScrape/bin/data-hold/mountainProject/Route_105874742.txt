route_description: Haley's Comet ascends the arête on the far left edge of the Manure Pile Buttress.  Fun face climbing past 4 good bolts to a 2-bolt anchor shared with Jump for Joy.  Although the route is bolted, it is not really a "sport" climb, as there are only 4 protection bolts in 65 feet.  A fall before clipping the second bolt would likely result in a ground fall.  As such, I have given it a "PG-13" rating.  If you are not up for leading the route, it is possible to scramble up the gully to the left with a section of 4th class terrain, do one single rope rap down to the anchors.  One more rap gets you to the ground.
