description: Robson is the highest peak of the Canadian Rockies, a commanding 700 feet higher than the second highest in the range (Mount Columbia-12,294), and rightfully known as "The King of the Rockies".  Like all great peaks, there is no easy way to the summit.  The famous Austrian guide Conrad Kain, author of the first two routes on Robson, proclaimed upon first sight of the peak, "God made the mountains, but good God! who made Robson?"  This complex mountain has many distinct characters, depending on the aspect.  The North Face is known for its steep ice walls, the south side for complex, "gargoyle" studded rock & snow ridges, and the legendary Emperor Face, rising over 9000' from the valley below, for its daring mixed lines that push the limits of modern alpine abilities.    Although the "Wishbone Arete" was selected for Steck & Roper's "Fifty Classic Climbs of North America", this is generally considered a poor choice by Canadian Rockies & '50 Classics' connoiseurs alike, as a number of better lines exist on the peak.  Sean Dougherty, author of "Select Alpine Climbs in the Canadian Rockies" calls the line "...somewhat over-rated considering the amount of loose rock & the long approach."  The mountain's impressive size and intimidating vertical relief make one-day ascents uncommon.  Weather is a major factor in this part of the Canadian Rockies, and the mountain is said to create its own weather.  Some years the mountain may not be climbed at all, and in one 14-year period from 1939 to 1953, the mountain did not receive a singel ascent!  For routes on the South side, the Ralph Forster Hut is a key consideration.  Most North side routes will begin from a bivy at Berg Lake.  Most ascents take place from August to September. 
getting_there: From Banff, follow the Icefields Parkway (93) North ~285 breathtaking KM to Jasper.  From Jasper, head west on Hwy 16 (Yellowhead Hwy) for 85 Km, then turn right on an access road that heads to the Berg Lake Trail.  Follow this rd for 2Km & park.  All routes begin from this trailhead.
