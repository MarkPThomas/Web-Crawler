route_description: This is one of the classic must-do moderate routes.  It almost always has someone on it or in line (sorta like Supercrack at IC).  And it's definitely worth the wait.  Expect a sustained climb with three definite parts, and good rests in between each - it's harder than it looks, and the cruxes are pumpy.  Reach the climb about 350 feet (less than .1 mile) past a large break in the otherwise solid wall of Wall Street.  If you pass a long (several hundred feet) section of lower angled slabs, you've gone too far.  Lieback and jam a left-facing corner (with a couple of face features for variety) at the right end of a 3-car turnout for 80' to good anchors on the facing wall.  Rap the route.
