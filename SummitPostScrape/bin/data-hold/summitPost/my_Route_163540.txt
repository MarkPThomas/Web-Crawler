This route starts on the summit of the American Fork Twins and goes to one of the minor summits. Take any route to the summit of the mountain, and go to the lower eastern summit.<br>

<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
The route is very straightforward - from the eastern summit of the American Fork Twin Pks, drop to the south into a mild saddle and continue along the ridge spur to the "Nipple". I've found the terrain easiest if I stay right on the ridge and occasionally drop off to the west.<br>
<br>
Admittedly the route isn't much, but the "3rd Nipple"  does provide interesting views of the Alpine Ridge and American Fork Canyon and can be tempting for avid peakbaggers, given its ease of access and proximity to the main summit.<br>
