description: Major Features: The Uberfall is the first section of rock you encounter as you walk north from the steel bridge that separates the Trapps from the Nears.  On most in-season weekend days, a Preserve ranger is parked at the Uberfall, and it's a very social area.  Lest you think the Uberfall is named for the trickle (or, in season, the pouring) of water that descends down the escarpment here, Dick Williams wrote in his 1991 guide: The Uberfall acquired its name, according to Fritz Weissner in a 1960 Appalachia article, from 'the method used in the descent of letting oneself, with outstretched arms, fall across the four-foot gap between the massif and a huge block (Susie A) above the road'.   For our purposes, routes in this section include the beginning of the cliff -- the big whitish face you pass closest to, just where the carriage road takes a slight turn, is Katzenjammer.  We'll end the Uberfall section just past the striking, right-leaning crack, Ken's Crack. The very last route in this section is the corner system of Trapped Like a Rat, which starts with a left-leaning hand crack, just behind the kiosk, the Hans Krauss plaque, and is almost directly across from the vault toilet (the "Uberpooper"). The next section is b. Jackie and friends.  There are two landmarks within the Uberfall: the Gerdie Block is a huge block leaning against the cliff with the routes Herdie Gerdie, Dirty Gerdie, and Nurdie Gerdie (aka Dogs in Heat); on the block's right side is the short crack of Red Cabbage.  Just below the carriage road across from Nosedive is another big block -- the Mental Block.  It contains one of the Gunks' true crack lines, Sonja, and several other harder cracks, which face the road.  Approach:  Most Uberfall routes start almost directly from the carriage road.  A trail runs along the cliff between The Brat and the Gerdie Block.  Descents from most routes involves walking off; most Uberfall routes are single-pitch.  Closer to the very beginning, you'll be able to walk back and scramble down behind the cliff.  It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the Uberfall Descent, which provides the walkoff for the majority of Uberfall routes as well as many beyond it.
