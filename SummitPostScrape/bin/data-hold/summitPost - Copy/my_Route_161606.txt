<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
There are several variations to get to the summit. The ridge between Pioneer Peak and Sunset Peak is discussed on the Sunset Peak page. To gain the ridgeline, you can follow the Brighton Ridge Run route and cut off early on many of the cat track trails to go directly to the Crest Express Lift. For a better workout, take the Brighton Ridge Run.<br>

   Distance: TBA<br>
    Elevation Gain: 1,650'<br>
    Follow the Lake Mary Trail 0.73 miles to the turnoff to Dog Lake. Take the turnoff. As you near Dog Lake, the trail will split - take the left fork. The trail will gradually ascend as it traverses across the Brighton Ski Resort. Slightly farther than 1.21 miles from Dog Lake the trail reaches the ridgeline at a cat-track linking the Snake Creek lift to the Great Western lift. This point is known as Snake Creek  Pass. Walk towards the Snake Creek lift and travel cross-country over peak 10315. The terrain is fairly open, and occasionally a use-trail is visible. Eventually the Crest Express lift is reached. Continue along the ridgeline over peak 10321. As you go over the far side of the peak, a much better defined use trail can be seen below to the left. Follow this trail to the saddle below Pioneer Peak and all the way to the summit. <br>
