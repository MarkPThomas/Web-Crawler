description: The Moab area in the eastern section of Utah is amazlingly rich with bountiful opportunities for the rock climber who can appreciate the stark beauty of soft sandstone in a desert environment.  There is more than a lifetime of climbing here!  Moab is a small community, located along US 191 at the intersection with SR 128 (River Rd) south of I-70, which has become popular with the climbing and mountain biking communities of late.  Its elevation at 4025' make spring and fall make for the most pleasant times for visitors.  It is generally quite dry here; however, wandering along the River Road after a large rainfall can provide spectacular waterfall viewing.  Here, you can find climbs ranging from 1 pitch sport climbs up to 600' desert spires to multi-day adventures on the 900' The Titan to 1200' ridge/aid climbs like Everyman's Endless Edge.  Desert spires can be hauntingly beautiful like Moses, Zeus, and Aphrodite in Taylor Canyon.  Of course, there is the world-class desert crack climbing of Indian Creek.  There miles and miles of cliffs along the River Road.  You will find an wide range of subtle variations in rock type: the splitter-crack-forming Windgate, the ultra-soft Entrada, the gorgeous Navajo, the oddly solid-yet crumbly Cutler, the interesting mid-layers of Chinle, Kayenta, and more.  You must be cautious treading on desert rock for longer-than-you-think after any significant precipitation.  Most folks will find the Windgate to be most inviting here.  You climbing armamentarium will likely include beefier ropes, helmets, plenty of cams, a healthy supply of tape, and likely some anti-inflammatories for afterwards.  Most adventure climbs will require at least a double set of cams.  New climbs may require investigation of the pro & cons of desert anchors like drilled angle pins vs. expansion bolts vs. glue-in bolts.  You will likely find your gear shedding red sandstone dust for days after your visits.  New climbs in the National Parks may require particular creativity for new anchors.  Some adventure climbs will require high-clearance 4WD type vehicle to allow access.  You can climb truly roadside all the way to real adventure climbing. Weather can vary from extremes of debilitating heat to mud-trapping rain storms to frosty climes.  Pay particular attention to quick-moving lightning storms, since these are probably a climber's biggest threat here.  Be particularly careful with the delicate cryptogametic soils in the area which are key in providing soil stability and microbiotic communities in what looks like mud.  There are some areas with strict regulations, particularly in the National Parks like Canyonlands N.P. and Arches N.P.  So, check in advance.  In particular, be extremely respectful of any petroglyphs or pictographs you find.  Nonetheless, come find your personal gems here....
