<div>Joel Wilson, Vlad Sofiyev, and Michael Ybarra and I did a quick trip to Washington to climb Mt Rainier via Disappointment Cleaver. I had just finished finals at UC Berkeley the day before the drive, and there was just enough time to drive to Washington, do the climb, and make it back for my undergrad graduation ceremony. Since family was coming to that, I certainly couldn't risk missing it! We had whiteout conditions on the first day climbing to the Muir Hut, but fortunately when we awoke at 2am, the skies were clear. We had a straightforward climb to the summit and back down that second day.</div>
