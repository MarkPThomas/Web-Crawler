route_description: This is a good route that has a bit of loose rock on it. The first 3 pitches are nice sustained 5.8/9, then the 5-7th pitches get harder. The 5th goes up a corner and you've got to get out of the corner and around the arete to the right. My friend Alex took a chunk out of the arete here.  Then the next pitch is classic Kor 5.9. You'll feel a total body pump by the time you get to the belay.
