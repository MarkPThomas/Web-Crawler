Always run ruby files from the root directory with:
$ ruby [relative path]\[name].rb

Any ruby program can be stopped on the command line by simply hitting CTRL-c. 


========== Tests ================
Run tests with: 

$ rake test

Test files go in tests/ and are named test_BLAH.rb otherwise rake test won't run them. 
This also keeps your tests from clashing with your other code.

Write one test file for each module you make.


=========== Server ===============
Sinatra is the server
Use app.rb in the gothonweb project as a template for running the server from a ruby file
When running Sinatra, close it with ctrl-c

When you make a change to your Sinatra application you need to stop it and run it again. 
Simply hit CTRL-c and it will stop. 
Then run the command ruby bin/app.rb again to start it. 
You can also use a tool called rerun to automate this. 

Use it like this:

$ rerun 'ruby bin/app.rb'

Now make a change to the bin/app.rb file that's small and it should stop then rerun your Sinatra application. 
It can take a few seconds for rerun to detect the change, but it should work.
