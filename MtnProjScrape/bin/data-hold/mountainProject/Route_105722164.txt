route_description: Don't be fooled!  While only 5.7, Dolphin is a "classic" grovel/grunt (if you're into that sort of thing).  As one ascends, the crack widens.  Towards the top, scoot your #5 Camalot up in between mandatory cursing.  To descend, either rap Bird of Fire or walk/downclimb via 4th class ramp to the south (climber's left).
