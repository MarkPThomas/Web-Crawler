description: Close to HVCG yet you never see anyone on it.  This rock may have the best 5.4 chimney in the park for whatever that's worth. 
getting_there: This is the formation between the Blob and Rock Hudson.  From the end of the main loop in HVCG towards the Outback.  Outhouse Rock is directly to your right.
