message: I've gotten quite proficient at the LeConte Boulder bolt ladder, and the Kor Roof on the S Face of Washington Column was easy. These 6 bolts kicked my butt! Definitely be ready to use your aiders in pairs on this one. Also, my short reach forced me to snag a shallow finger pocket to stay upright in the top step just barely long enough to clip the last bolt.
