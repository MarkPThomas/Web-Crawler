<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Approach</h2>
<br>
Park at the near end (i.e. west end) of the Brighton ski resort parking lot. From here, follow the dirt road that begins underneath one of the ski lifts - of course if its winter and you're lazy, you can always ride the lift for a shortcut :-o<br>
<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
Distance: 2 miles<br>
Elevation: 1,722'<br>
<br>
Follow the dirt road as it switchbacks up the hill towards the Twin Lakes Reservoir. Follow a road that winds to the left of the dam. This road switchbacks up the left side of the reservoir until the highest ski lift exit is reached. From here the route is straightforward - just start scrambling up the ridge! It is a boulder-hop on fairly stable large talus blocks.<br>

<br>
Bring the 10 Essentials. For winter climbs, bring an avy beacon and snowshoes or skis. An ice axe may be desireable for spring snow conditions.<br>
