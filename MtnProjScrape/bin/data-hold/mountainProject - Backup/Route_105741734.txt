route_description: This is the crack system left of Dream Slate, that works left of the flake that you put an SLCD in for Dream Slate.  It works through a slot in the roof layer and then angles right, past a tree and finishes within arm's reach of the chains.  The pre-roof crack is fun, just a bit dirty, but fun, and it protects well.  The roof is also fun (not 5.9), but fun.  I felt like 5.8.  Above the roof, it gets dirty, rotten, easy, and almost no gear.  Worth one ascent, no more, no less.
