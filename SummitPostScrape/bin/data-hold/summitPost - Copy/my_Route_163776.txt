<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Approach</h2>
<br>
Approach from the parking lot west of the rock. Contour around to the north until you're between the two main summits of Lembert Dome.<br>
<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>
<br>
Between the steep north faces of the two summits the angle of the rock eases enough to allow one to ascend an easy route to the cleft dividing the summits.  The route has some loose scree, as well as some loose plates of granite on the middle portion, but otherwise the rock is solid.<br>
<br>
The route begins as a friction climb on undulating granite. It is easiest heading to climber's left and then angling back to the right.<br>
Once the route narrows, one can mostly friction climb straight up the middle or use some small finger cracks along the base of the cliffs to the right.  Once at the notch, circle around to the south slopes or head up the class 3 ledges and chimney to get out of the notch. From there it is an easy walk to the summit.<br>
<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Essential Gear</h2>
<br>
A good pair of shoes. A helmet might be wise if you don't tread lightly.<br>
