route_description: P1: Start left of The Flake in an easy crack.  Several variations exist.  Belay on gear below the summit overhang as for North Overhang.    P2: Traverse out right with good hands and not so good feet.  Be sure to protect the follower, as a fall will land them out in space.  Pull up onto airy ledge, delicately reach up to clip the bolt, and continue up face to the summit.  Belay from 2-bolt anchor.    Descent: With one rope, rap from same bolt anchor to the north back to starting ledge.
