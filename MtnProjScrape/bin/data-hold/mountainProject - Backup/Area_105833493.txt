area_name: Higher Cathedral Rock Rock Climbing  
area_url: /v/higher-cathedral-rock/105833493 
description: Higher Cathedral Rock is a beautiful, large formation perched uphill from Middle Cathedral. Although it's a bit of an uphill hike to get to, compared to some other routes in the Valley, the lack of other climbers, and the views are well worth the hoof. The two most popular routes on HCR are probably the NE Buttress (5.9), a long and varied route often described as the "best 5.9 in the Valley", and Braille Book (5.8), a really nice moderate six-pitch route on the left side of the formation. 
getting_there: Higher Cathedral Rock is the leftmost of the three Cathedral Rocks, found just south across the valley from El Capitan.
