description: At 14,088 ft (4,294 m), Mt. Russell is the 7th highest peak in California, and one of 15 above 14,000' in the state.  It's a very fine peak, with many classic routes, including its easier routes, a very worthwhile objective. 
getting_there: Approach from Whitney Portal via the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek.  This is the same approach used for the East Face, East Buttress, and Mountaineer's Routes on Mt. Whitney.  If overnighting, you must obtain a wilderness permit for the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek by following a specific set of procedures outlined on the forest service's website.  Allow about 5 hours from Whitney Portal to Iceberg Lake if carrying full packs with overnight gear.
