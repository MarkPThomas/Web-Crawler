route_description: Good Wide Climbing on the far west side of narcolepsy area. Nice cracks, mostly hands with some places a good deal wider. Belay is very awkward to set up. I continued to the top (climb east to attain narcolepsy anchors) and rapped down narcolepsy. This continuation is highly recommended to avoid the walk off to the west. A good crack for the leader trying to break into the grade. It felt a bit soft for a 5.8 to me.
