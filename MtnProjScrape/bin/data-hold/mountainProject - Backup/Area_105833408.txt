description: Sentinel Rock sits perched like a big dark tombstone above the Valley floor, right across from Yosemite Falls. Climbing on Sentinel is pretty cool, because you get a bird's eye view of both the Falls and El Capitan, just around the corner to the east. The most popular route on Sentinel is the Steck-Salathe route (5.9), first climbed by Yosemite legends Allen Steck and John Salathe back in 1950.   Warning: The descent gully, off the backside of the rock, is hazardous and climbers should take extra care when descending!!! 
getting_there: Sentinel Rock is found on the south side of the Valley, across from Yosemite Falls. You can park for the Four-Mile Trail to approach.
