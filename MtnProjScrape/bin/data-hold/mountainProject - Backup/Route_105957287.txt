route_description: This route is fun, and goes to a cool summit on a very cool looking spire. The approach is very short.  The climbing is relatively moderate, and it's sort of an easy tick for a desert spire.  It's a good one.  The route goes up cracks facing the road via free and aid climbing, until you get to a bolt ladder to the top.  I free climbed to 5.9, but you could free climb 5.10 if you wanted to.
