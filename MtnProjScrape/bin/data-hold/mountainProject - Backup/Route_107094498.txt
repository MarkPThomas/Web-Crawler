route_description: This crack climb is probably one of the most awesome boulder problems ever!  Short walk from the campsites in Camp4 and has a bit of a rocky landing so you might want more than 1 pad.  A super classic boulder problem!!  Sit start deep at the base of the crack on a jug and climb straight out!
