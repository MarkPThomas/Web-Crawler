<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Getting There</h2>
<br>
Mt. Winchell is located in the Palisade region of the Sierra Nevada. To access the eastern routes drive to the end of the road in Glacier Canyon (Big Pine Creek). Follow the north fork (of Big Pine Creek) past first, second, and third lakes.  When you come to the junction with the Sam Mack Meadows trail follow that trail to the meadows.  Climb any of the chutes that leaves the meadows and head toward the Thunderbolt Glacier.  Mount Winchell is  to the north of Thunderbolt Peak.<br>
<br>
The access to the western routes on Mount Winchell can be achieved by taking Bishop Pass to the Dusy Basin area.  To get there, one takes the South Lake Road which leaves Highway  168 approximately  fifteen miles from Bishop.  From the trailhead at South Lake the trail climbs gradually to join the junction with the Treasure Lakes trail at one mile (10,240 feet).  The Bishop Pass Trail goes left and continues to climb.  After this the trail follows the eastern aspect  of the picturesque Long Lake.  After passing Saddlerlock and Bishop Lake, many switchbacks lead to the summit of Bishop Pass (11,960 feet).  Then one descends into Dusy Basin which is the stepping off point to the western aspect of Winchell<br>
