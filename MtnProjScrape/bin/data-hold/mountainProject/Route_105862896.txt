route_description: The Northeast Buttress of Higher Cathedral Rock has a reputation for being a fantastic climb -- Don Reid refers to it as one of the best grade IV's in the Valley, and SuperTopo raves about its 5-star quality.  Most people I've spoken with who have climbed it enjoyed the route but didn't necessarily go on and on about it.  Personally, I thought the climb was average in quality and less than the spectacular classic it is made out to be.  The NEB has some things going for it: such as a few stand-out pitches (but only a few), very sustained climbing pitch-for-pitch, and a relatively steep line.  Going against it is much less-than-memorable climbing, and of course a pretty lengthy approach and walkoff.  Climb it and decide for yourself.  Follow the standard Higher Cathedral Rock approach.  The NEB is before one arrives at Braille Book -- these two climbs bookend the large, steep, mostly blank east wall of Higher Cathedral.  It begins at a blocky, left-facing corner.  P1: Scramble to the top of the blocks, then trend left to a long right-facing corner of 5.6 cracks.  Belay on a ledge at bolts.  5.6.  P2: Climb a steep 5.8 crack or an ugly slot to the right.  Trend right and then wander up crack systems to a belay by a tree and a weird pillar of rock.  5.6.  P3: Climb 5.8 & 5.9 hands through some roofs and continue up crack systems to a belay on a ledge.  P4: Climb a long, steep left-facing corner through several bulges.  Link this pitch easily into the next one with a long runner.  5.8.  P5: Traverse straight left across an exposed face.  Various gear, some fixed pro, and some bits of downclimbing lead to a bolted belay on a long flake/ledge system.  This pitch is where Mary's Tears crosses the route and continues into the Crucifix.  This is also the halfway point and where the climbing turns physical.  5.8.  P6-8: Climb steep crack systems of all sizes, including ugly squeezes, belaying where necessary, until exiting a 5.8 chimney and belaying to the left at bolts.  The supposed crux pitch is a nice, clean corner protected with a few pins.  Not too bad compared to the steep squeezes and OW on other parts of the climb.  5.9.  P9: Traverse left past a beautiful looking fist crack in a right-facing corner, downclimb a bit, then continue left to easier flakes and tree climbing.  Belay here, or if you runner things very well it is possible to link to the next pitch.  5.9.  P10: Climb up the crack system to a belay at a tree.  5.8.  P11: Perhaps the true crux of the climb.  Continue up very steep, awkward cracks to a face traverse to an obvious tree out left.  Runner your gear well, and launch up from the tree to a strenuous, possibly unprotected, 5.8 squeeze to a dirty mantle to the top.  5.8+.  Descend towards the top of Braille Book, continue past it and down the saddle to the east, eventually some manzanita tunnelling will return you to your packs.
