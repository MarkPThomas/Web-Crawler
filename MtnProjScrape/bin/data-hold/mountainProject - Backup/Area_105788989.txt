description: Smith Rock is Oregon's premier rock climbing destination, and one of the best sport climbing areas in the United States.  This world-renowned sport climbing mecca has more than once been at the focal point of the climbing world.  Extensive development took place in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s by locals and international climbers alike, who put up scores of classic climbs on the tuff and basalt cliffs; development continues to this day with new moderates and cutting-edge routes going up each year.  Ranging from classic beginner routes to hardcore testpieces on a wide variety of rock, there is truly something here for everyone.  Although best known for its sport climbing traditional climbers can find plenty to be excited about here as well.  Located in the high desert in central Oregon, Smith Rock State Parks cliffs and hillsides take a commanding presence over the surrounding terrain.  The main cliffs are made of volcanic welded tuff, and surrounding bands of columnar basalt lie above the winding Crooked River.  Smith Rock is a perfect weekend getaway for residents of the Portland area as well as a worthy destination for anybody exploring the Wests climbing.  The prominent walls overlooking the Crooked River are home to many of Smith Rocks most famous routes, but for those seeking some solitude and adventure there is plenty to be found on the back side or among the basalt columns in the Upper and Lower gorge.  Monkey Face, perhaps the parks most recognizable feature, sits proudly on the back side of Smith Rock with spectacular views of the Cascade Mountains and the arid landscape below.  It takes years to become familiar with all of the areas at Smith, and there is enough climbing here to allow even the locals to find new favorites every season.  There are over 1,500 routes at Smith but it's easy to get stuck in a cycle where you only climb the same 50 classics each season; a little exploring here to the less-traveled areas goes a long way.  Approaches are generally short and straightforward from the main parking lot, and a well-maintained system of trails provides easy access to all of the parks areas.  Please dont stray from the established trails; the visual and environmental impact of people scrambling up the hillsides can be enormous.  There is water available at the parking lot and a drinking fountain at the bridge, although they both get turned off during the cold months.  I've heard that the water from the sinks in the bathrooms isn't potable so bring your own to be on the safe side if the fountains are shut off.  Restrooms are available in the main parking lot, at the bridge, and the Phoenix Composting Toilet is conveniently located within sprinting distance of the popular walls on the front side of the park.  Please respect those around you, keep your pets under control, and pack out everything that you bring in.  If you've never been to Smith Rocks before, there is an overview map posted here  that can help you find your way around. The areas to the left are organized in the same fashion as the Watt's Guidebook, going to the left from Picnic Lunch Wall, to Monkey Face, and then across to Red Wall and towards the Monument Wall and around the gorge.
