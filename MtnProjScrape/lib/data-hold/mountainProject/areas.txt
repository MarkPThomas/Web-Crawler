The wall is south facing so it is a good location to climb on those cool days when you are looking for a warm place to climb.  [Reprinted with permission from Jed Botsford, Climbing Ranger - RRCNCA].   
getting_there: The approach for the Tuna and Chips Wall is the same as for the Dog Wall, but instead of turning out of the side canyon continue up canyon to the base of the Tuna and Chips Wall.

area_name: Mescalito Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/mescalito/105732159 
description: This formation was known as Red Cap back in the sixties.  The Mescalito name was given by Red Rock pioneer Jeff Lansing (who coincidentally did the first ascent of the formation's east face).  It looks like a cute little summit, dwarfed by much larger mountains on both sides.  But do not be fooled; climbing to the summit involves ten or twelve pitches and a noticeable descent effort.  There is quite a wide spectrum of climbing.  Cat in the Hat and Dark Shadows are probably the two most popular routes with visiting climbers, and they well deserve their "classic" status.  Lots of other climbs are of similar quality; Risky Business, Y2K, Cookie Monster, and a bunch more.   
getting_there: Hike west on the main Pine Creek trail.  A short distance beyond the mouth of the canyon the streambed forks.  Stay to the right for routes from Y2K around toward Dark Shadows.  Cross the streambed and work up the south fork for routes from Cookie Monster and left toward Cat in the Hat.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/glacier-point-apron/105862612 
description: At the east end of Yosemite Valley rising up above Happy Isles lies a massive slab of beautiful granite that slopes up towards Glacier Point. This wall has some of the best slab climbing in the valley, and also some of the worst rock fall potential.  In 1999 Peter Terbush was killed by a massive rock fall while his two partners escaped with lacerations.  With that warning in mind Glacier Point offers moderate classic routes with a very short approach, and shouldn't be missed. 
getting_there: From the Happy Isles trailhead parking lot walk up the path towards Little Yosemite. After about five minutes you will see the Nature Center to the right of the trail. Shortly after the Nature Center follow a fairly good path to the right towards the slabs. This will take you up through the forest and rockfall to the base of the wall. The approach from the trail turn off takes about ten minutes.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-west-slabs/105739542 
description: The North summit of Mt. Olympus can be seen from most of Salt Lake City.  The West Slabs are on the far right of the visible face.  They can easily be picked out by a big drainage (often filled with snow) which goes up to the base.  Above the drainage is a huge low angle face.  The face can be climbed basically anywhere, and is over 1500' feet high. 
getting_there: Check out Ruckman's newest guidebook for really good directions.  The old Wasatch Climbing North guidebook by Ruckman has out of date instructions which were the norm before new houses were built.  The parking for this face is in a subdivison above Wasatch Blvd.  To get there, turn from Wasatch onto Oakview, then a right on Jupiter, a left on Adonis, and a right on Thousand Oaks Drive.  Keep following the dead end signs up to Thousand Oaks Circle.  Park here.  At the end of this circle, a really steep dirt trail heads up the hill.  Take the first left off of this (not very pronounced, only a short distance from the road), which goes up to a dirt road.  Go left on this dirt road, almost immediately encountering a black gate with a security camera in view.  Skirt around this fence on the uphill side using the obvious trail.  Drop back down to the road once past the fence.  Follow this road for quite a ways, eventually finding a cairn which makes an exit trail.  Follow this a small ways to another good cairn in a drainage.  This drainage is the key to finding the route.  Just follow the drainage, which trends right (south), and eventually starts climbing up to the slabs.  The last long strectch which approaches the slabs is often filled with snow.  An ice axe is very useful, and some people even use crampons (probably not necessary).  Finish up this couloir to the base of the slabs.

getting_there: This island of quartzite rises out of the Storm Mountain Picnic area, about 2.8 miles up the canyon on the left.  Wake up the guy at the camper near the entrance to pay your $5 entrance fee, or not.  Climbers can park out on the highway and walk in for free if they're not using the picnic facilities.   The crag is across the bridge to the south via several short paths that scramble up through the trees/talus.

area_name: Wind Tower - SW Face Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/wind-tower---sw-face/105744711 
description: This popular rock can be divided in character into its south and southwest face.  The SW face has some of the most frequently climbed routes in Eldorado Canyon and is probably the best area in Eldorado Canyon for those seeking lower end difficulty climbing.  The rock is stellar for the first two pitches of climbs on this face.  Above this the rock has seen less traffic and still has loose rock for the unsuspecting climber.  Famous climbers have been climbing this rock since the early 1950s.  On occasion, you may find yourself face-to-face with a legendary climber soloing on by you as enjoy this rock.   Ultra-classics such as Calypso, 5.6 and Wind Ridge, 5.6 are great for beginners but often have long queues, please be patient.  Pitch 3 of Wind Ridge has one of the most interesting roofs in all of Eldorado Canyon.  Other good lines include Breezy, 5.4; The Bomb, 5.4; Boulder Direct, 5.5; the irascible Tigger, 5.5; Recon, 5.6; Reggae, 5.8; Wind Tower Slab, 5.9 TR; the slippery Tagger, 5.10b/c; and the impressive Salvation, 5.12a/b s.  Note, that according to Park statistics, Calypso is one of the most hazardous routes in the park, so protect it well. 
getting_there: The approach takes an arduous 5 min. from the parking lot.  Take the bridge across S. Boulder Creek, then take the marked path up to the wall. Please stay on the path since it is well built to minimize erosion and rock slide.

description: Unmistakable and outstanding, its jutting east face is obvious from anywhere in Boulder, and the beautiful, solid rock meets or exceeds your high expectations. A 100-foot-high "CU" was painted on since the 1940s. Since camouflaged by more paint, you can still see the faint outline. Of course, when you're on the east face, it's obvious when you get to this section of the rock, especially because it's a smeary section of rock with no hand holds, mostly friction foot moves. Enjoy it when you can: the Parks department closes this and  most of the rocks around it, due to raptor nesting concerns (see below).  Note, the Ghetto is actually part of the Third Flatiron. 
getting_there: From the ranger cottage at the Chautauqua Park trailhead (Baseline Rd.), follow the paved Bluebell Road south to the Bluebell Shelter. From the shelter follow the Royal Arch trail south to the junction of the Second-Third Flatiron Trail. Follow this trail west to the clearly marked Third Flatiron Trail. The trail ends at the start of the Third Flatiron standard east face climbing route. The Third Flatiron Descent Trail starts in the saddle to the west of the summit of the Third Flatiron. The trail begins to descend north, then east, down through a talus field to end at the Third Flatiron Trail, a few hundred yards north of  the start to the standard east face climbing route.

area_name: Long's Peak/Mt. Meeker Cirque Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/longs-peakmt-meeker-cirque/105746979 
description: This is the wonderful cirque that sits below the summits of Mt. Meeker and Long's Peak. A ton of ice forms up here during 9 months of the year, but most agree that the best time to climb is in the fall, when the days are warm enough to form the drips, yet they freeze at night. These drips are ephemeral: what is in one day may be gone by the time you hear about it. The best condition reports are word of mouth (or right here), or visually from the Front Range. The best conditions are found for a few days after Fall snow storms, when it's in the 70s down low. Look for fresh snow up high and sunny skies. Often the ice dries up in the middle of winter. It's just too  cold up there to keep ice forming. It tends to come back in in early April. In a good year, the ice routes back in the chimneys on the North Face of Meeker (Dark Star, etc.) stay in until early July.  Hint: this is a huge area, and the climbs are farther away than you think. From the observation points at the shelter cabin or Chasm Lake, climbs may not look like they're in. To really tell, though, you've got to make the whole approach. 
getting_there: Approach from the Long's Peak ranger station. Follow the signs to Chasm  Lake: for most people it takes about 2 hours. After you go over Chasm  Cut-off and the trails heads downhill, look for Peacock Pool below you on  the left along with Columbine Falls dropping into the pool. There are some great practice thin smears there as well as the low-angle slabs of Columbine. Above the trail, on the right flank of Mt. Lady Washington, several good 3-pitch falls form up in good years. These are nice because they catch the sun all day. For Long's and Meeker, keep going to the shelter cabin. If you're heading to Mt. Meeker, head left here, for the Long's Peak climbs, hike up the slabs directly behind the cabin. Once at the lake, you'll be able to see just about everything that's in, so make your choice there.

The East Summit is clearly the highest point (12,250'+), but the West Face has the most interesting climbing.  Most parties climbing this face are satisfied with the West Summit (12,240').  Secor seems to suggest that the West Summit is the true summit, but several route descriptions (the SW Face and W Chute, in particular), could only be describing routes that visibly reach the East Summit.  It is possible to traverse from the West to the East summit.  The West Summit - which has a register - appears to be climb on average once every two years.  East Summit Routes: NE Face West Chute SW Face SW Chute - the best descent  West Summit Routes: West Face Wilson Route (aka the North Face or the West Face, Left) Keith-Lowery Route (aka West Face, Right) SW Buttress - the best descent  Reference:  Secor, The High Sierra, 3rd ed., pg 238.

description: The southernmost of a trio of peaks (Merriam, Royce, Feather) which enclose the west side of the Royce Lakes Cwm - or Hall of the Mountain Gods as I call it. As such the area is unique in the High Sierra, as the peaks immediately west of the official crest are higher than the crest peaks.  Not only is there a classic IV 5.10 on the north buttress of this peak, but there has also been significant new route development there in the last few years, by Peter Croft, Lisa Rands and others. 
getting_there: Take the Pine Creek Road off Highway 395 to the Pine Creek trailhead, by the Tungsten Mill. Hike up an old road switchbacking its way monotonously up to the forest, then round the corner and into the much better scenery at Pine Lake. Head around the north side of the lake and take the trail, past Upper Pine Lake, to Honeymoon Lake, continue to follow the trail to Granite Park  but cut south west when above the lake and head cross-country up and over Royce Pass (11,680ft). Head straight west to a wonderful gravel spot just north of the middle (largest) of Royce Lakes. A spectacular place.  Alternate route recommended by Squiddo and more than likely easier:  On the way back we took the alternate approach that heads West from the Southern end of the Royce Lakes Basin and travels across some very pleasant terrain to meet the Pine Creek Pass trail right below French lake above Pine Creek pass itself. The second part of this trail was very well cairned out and obviously used/loved/maintained.   Perhaps 1 hour max from the end of Royce Lakes to the Pine Lake Pass trail.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/incredible-hulk/105852180 
description: This crag in the Sawtooth Range can honestly lay claim to being one of the biggest granite walls in the High Sierra. Essentially the culmination of the north ridge of Eocene Peak. It is separated from the towers to the south by a significant notch, which forms part of the standard descent route (see below). 
getting_there: The trailhead is at Twin Lakes/Mono Village, to park at the Marina you must pay $10.00.  Hike west along the Robinson Creek Trail to Little Slide Canyon - about where the Hoover Wilderness sign is. Negotiate boggy terrain and a couple of tributaries (sandals recommended, cache on other side) to the south bank of Robinson Creek, go right (west) and pick up "The Switchbacks" which are steep but short. Continue to follow the trail on less steep ground to the talus. Stay left of the creek; follow cairns up to a ramp with trees which passes beneath a waterfall. Here the trail is less obvious, but cairns do mark a way up over granite benches, and ledges to a flat area west of the Hulk and east of Maltby Lake.  About 6 hours with backpacks, 3 hours without. Some people mountain bike to the wilderness sign, some people do the Hulk in one long day, some people camp beneath the climbs - it's up to you, and how you view the mountains.  Descent from the Routes From the summit, and after paying homage to the Superball - make a steep and exposed Class 3 descent (nervous soloists need not apply) of the south ridge, about 300', near its terminus go left and descend down to the rappel anchor, where a single rope rappel will deposit you in the notch mentioned above. Go right (west) and descend steep and loose scree to a small tower and a branch. Take the left branch and Class 5 down climb the overhanging chockstone - very worrying. A little further you'll reach the main gully beneath the Incredible Hulk's wall - stagger and stumble down some of the worst scree I've ever seen back to the start of the climbs, and then down the final scree fan. Some may take 45 minutes to do this, I've seen it written up as "trivial" - IMHO it's more than both of these.

RJ Secor (The High Sierra: Peaks, Passes & Trails) describes 5 routes that will satisfy both mixed route aficionados and scramblers alike.  Additional information on the N Face is available from Moynier & Fiddler in California's High Sierra.  W Ridge (Class 3 from Piute Pass)S Slope (Class 3 from 0.25 miles past Loch Leven)SE Face (5.4 chimney, leaving the Piute Pass trail before Loch Leven)SW Ridge (Class 3 from the couloir between Piute Crags and Emerson)N Face (Class 4 mixed route from the cirque between Peak 1)   
getting_there: For all routes but the N Face: Passenger cars OK.  From central Bishop head W on highway 168 (aka W Line Street) for ~18 miles, passing the S Lake turn-off.  Take the right-hand turn onto N Lake Rd.  In early the season the road is gated and this will add ~1.7 miles to the trailhead.  Unless you are camping at the N Lake campground you will need to park at the large hiker lot and walk the ~0.4 miles to the trailhead.  From the campground take the trail toward Piute Pass.  For the N Face: High clearance required, 4x4 recommended.  From central Bishop head W on highway 168 (aka W Line Street) for ~10 miles to Dutch Johns Meadows Road (unmarked) behind an old wilderness kiosk on your right.  Head SW the due W along the road, taking a left-hand fork at ~6.2 miles toward the McGee Creek trailhead. Cross country toward the S Fork of McGee Creek.  Aim for the cirque between Checkered Demon (Peak 13,112) and Emerson.

Glaciers cleaved the dome clear in half, leaving incredible slab climbs on the sunny southern aspect such as Snake Dike (5.7) and Southern Belle (5.12) to amazingly steep lines on the NW face.  The namesake route (the "Regular" route) on the NW face is one of many aid climbers' first objectives, but it makes for a great, adventurous free climb as well.    Even the hiking route up to the summit visor, via the cables, is classic, and it is no wonder why this formation was used for the North Face's logo. 
getting_there: Half Dome takes a bit of work to get to. There are generally two approaches used by climbers:  1) Hike up from Happy Isles up the Mist Trail through Little Yosemite Valley (approx. 8 miles to the shoulder of Half Dome).  2) Head over from Happy Isles past Mirror Lake and hike up the "Death Slabs".  Option 1 is smooth hiking and clearly the way to go for the south facing routes.  Option 2 is significantly faster (for the NW face), in both directions, but requires skilled route finding, very steep hiking, and use of fixed lines.

area_name: Bugaboo Spire Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/bugaboo-spire/105868068 
description: This is one of the most impressive spires in all of the Bugaboo's hence the name.  From the Applebee campground the highly visible east face looms steep and nearly blank with only half a dozen or so routes.  Viewed from the top of Crescent Spire one gets a great look at the classic Northeast ridge and the entire spire as it shoots into the sky like a sharks tooth. 
getting_there: Most of the routes on the Bugaboo Spire are accessed via the Crescent glacier which is an easy hike from the Kain hut and Applebee campground.  From the Kain hut head north toward the Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col and turn off before the Col as if heading to the Crescent Spire.  From Applebee hike north out of camp onto the moraine and follow the same route as if going to Crescent Spire.  The east face is obvious on both approaches.  To get to the Northeast ridge follow the same approach as above and continue up slabs to the Bugaboo-Crescent Col.  All remaining routes on the south and west faces are approached by the Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col.

description: Crescent Towers is a series of summits consisting of the North, two Central, and two South "Donkey Ears" towers.  The towers lie between Crescent Spire and Eastpost Spire.  The area contains a collection of moderate climbs with a relatively easy approach. 
getting_there: If coming from the Kain Hut, take the obvious trail leading to the Applebee Dome campground.  From the trail system just below the campground, take the trail that leads up and left, aiming for the base of the large formation with the easily seen Donkey Ears protruding above.  If you loose the trail, find the path of least resistance; there appears to be several options.  The Crescent Towers can also be approached via the Crescent Glacier.

description: South Howser Tower is home to the mega-classic Beckey-Chouinard which is the most traveled route by far on the Howser Towers.  The west face is approximately 2000' tall with good quality rock but still only holds a handful of routes.   
getting_there: Of the three towers South Howser is the easiest to get to but still takes about a 2-3 hour approch from the Kain hut or Applebee campgound.  All routes on the west face are accessed via the Pigeon-Howser Col.  If starting from the Kain hut or Applebee campground, take the Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col up to the Upper Vowell Glacier.  Walk west across the Glacier to its high point, just north of the Pigeon Spire and drop down into the Pigeon-Howser Col.  Near the top of the col scramble down through some large bolders continuing down a steep loose slope till another glacier is reached.  Keep heading down the glacier avoiding some large crevasses and taking the path of least resistance.  As you drop farther below South Howser circle north and look for the East Creek Bivy site.  From the Bivy site you should be able to see most of the Tower and the routes.

The classic West Ridge is by far the most popular route on the spire and the main descent for all other routes.  The East face is the largest and most impressive side of the spire and easily viewable from the Pigeon Fork of the Bugaboo Glacier. 
getting_there: There are two approaches for the Pigeon Spire depending on your destination.  For the North Face and the West Ridge take the Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col to the Upper Vowell Glacier.  For the South and East Faces take the Bugaboo Glacier West passing the South Face of Snowpatch along the way.  Both approaches require glacier travel and can take one to two hours depending on the route your trying to get to.

Higher Spire was first climbed in April 1934, by Jules Eichorn, Bestor Robinson and Dick Leonard.   Chuck Wilts and Spencer Austin freed the route in 1944.  Descend by rappel.  Depending where you are on the Spire it may be shady and cold or sunny and warm. From the top of the spire you'll get some of the best views of El Cap in the Valley and a secluded summit from tourists. 
getting_there: The Cathedral Spires Area page has the parking and initial hiking information.  Upper Cathedral Spire is approached by going right and up the "Spires Gully", west of the formation, which is the same approach for Braille Book and Upper Cathedral Rock.

There are a couple of routes to the top of this short tower.  The rock is good, however, the summit has lots of loose stuff, so use good judgement.  The tower is not tall, but it does have about 50 feet of vertical climbing. 
getting_there: Driving through the park, take a right on the road which leads towards the Windows area, just past Balanced Rock.  Drive past the Garden of Eden road, down past Owl Rock, and as the road curves to the East, you can find atleast one pullout on the left side.  A 5 minute walk leads over rock slabs around a mini tower and meets up with the Bullwinkle Tower formation.  Bullwinkle Tower is recognized by the obvious west facing and south facing chimneys leading to its summit.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/castleton-tower/105716850 
description: Castleton Tower is probably the most famous desert tower in the world, and was the first major tower climbed in the Moab area.  The Kor-Ingalls route is one of the 50 Classic Climbs of North America, and Castleton also has one other 5.9 route of the same caliber.  Harder classic routes both aid and free exist on its fantastic Wingate sandstone with its unique calcite crust.  Castleton is most climber's first desert tower, and it is common for lines to form on the Kor-Ingalls during the spring and fall.  All the free routes are trad, and you should be solid at the grade - this is not a good place to break into 5.9. 
getting_there: Drive as far up the dirt road as you dare, and start hiking.  The road winds around the base of Castleton.  Look for a cairn on the right made from white rocks and do not be tempted to leave the road too early.  There is an excellent trail to the base of a small cliff band, at which point it turns towards the Rectory and the Priest.  Scramble easily through the cliffs(if you are scared there is a better way) and hike up steep scree to the base.  The approach takes an hour if you are in shape, but it is strenuous.

Some of the most famous cracks in the desert are here - Supercrack, Incredible Handcrack, Coyne Crack, etc.  Expect stellar climbing with good protection and a casual approach, but don't expect solitude.  If you are looking for solitude, please don't cross the road in search of it.  There is no access to the cliffs across the road without trespassing! 
getting_there: From the main parking area about 4 miles past Newspaper Rock, Supercrack Buttress will be obvious.  Follow a well worn trail to the base, and look for the crowds to mark the start of most routes.

You can't miss seeing the well-traveled splitter Generic Crack.  This is the most prominent feature on the Donnelly Canyon wall.  Donnelly Canyon is home to several moderate climbs and consequently, hordes of gumbies.  However, this is Indian Creek and there are several good lines on this wall.    Another lesser know attraction of Donnelly Canyon is its acoustics.  After a day of posing at either Super Crack Buttress or DC, you may find yourself enjoying a beer in the parking lot while you spray.  When you shut-up long enough to belch, be sure to aim in the direction of Generic Crack.  If you have any talent at all, then your mating call will be well amplified as it echoes and resonates out of the canyon.  To witness this awe-inspiring feat alone is worth the drive to the Creek.

It has some excellent shorter pitches ranging from trad to bolted, and provides a nice alternative if all of your planned routes at Reed's are occupied. The crag does get sun throughout the day, like Reed's, and has fantastic views of the Merced river and the Rostrum. Rock quality is excellent overall, and your standard Yosemite rack should suffice. Pitches are 70 - 130 feet, some routes have lowering anchors, others are walk off from the top.  
getting_there: Start from the Reed's parking pullout (b/w the tunnels on Hwy 120), and walk toward the eastern tunnel. As you walk along the road, look for a small climbers trail heading down the slope. The trail starts right at the tunnel, behind the sign that gives the tunnel height. Don't follow the quasi-trails that are right below the parking area. Navigate the loose dirt trail through the trees and head toward the cliff. This trail will circle around to the base of the cliff, and the approach time is roughly 10 minutes, although longer for the walk back out.

The wall is formed of white granite with cool black streaks running down it and it looms impressively over the Valley's Ahwahnee Hotel. Easily the most popular route on this wall is the moderate Royal Arches Route (5.10b or 5.7 A0), amazingly first climbed in 1936 by Ken Adam, Morgan Harris, and W. Kenneth Davis. This is a really cool experience for many first time Valley visitors, as the route takes you from floor to rim and is easily climbed in a day by most parties. 
getting_there: As with Washington Column, it used to be you could park at the Ahwahnee and hoof over to the Column on the bike path, but I've heard recently that you can't park there anymore (permit req'd?). Maybe someone can post up the current beta...

Layton Kor's ascent of the Finger of Fate was the subject of an article in National Geographic, and the climb is one of the 50 Classic Climbs of North America.  Harvey Carter, not to be outdone, added the incredible plumb line Sundevil Chimney, and later harder routes were added by Jim Beyer, Walt Shipley, and Duane Raleigh among others.  Stevie Haston made an impressive attempt to free the Finger of Fate, but still had to resort to a few moves of aid - so the Titan is still awaiting a FFA.  Update - Stevie Haston has apparently freed the Sundevil Chimney at 5.13  This is pretty mind blowing - if the Titan can be freed probably any tower can. 
getting_there: Walk along the trail until at the base of the Titan.  Sundevil Chimney is the first route reached.  To reach the Finger of Fate, keep traversing around the base until it is possible to scramble up on ledges.

The rock is soft entrada, but it is split with many long crack systems that provide good free and moderate aid routes.  Most routes are three pitches long.  The West Face is the classic free route at 5.11 with a really nice 5.10ish hands first pitch(also goes easily at A1).  Speak No Evil is a nice thin crack system on the east face that can be clean aided. 
getting_there: Drive up the road from the visitors center to the Courthouse Towers pullout.  The Three Gossips is on the left side of the road opposite from the Organ and The Tower of Babel.  There isn't really a trail to the base, but you can easily reach it by walking along washes and boulders.  All routes are most easily reached by scrambling up to the West Face and traversing from there.  The slickrock below Speak No Evil and other east face routes is harder to climb than it looks.

description: Washer Woman and its neighbor Monster Tower are two incredible  Wingate formations located right off the White Rim jeep trail.  Standing nearly 500' tall, it is one of the largest towers in  Canyonlands National Park and a very worthy objective for any  desert climber.  Once the towers are in view it is obvious which one is Washer Woman and where the name came from.  Take a good look at the arch in the center of the formation.  You will be getting a much better one on rappel if you are successful climbing this giant!  The remote location combined with the high quality climbing and amazing views of the White Rim make this an incredible experience which I highly recommend. 
getting_there: Good directions can be found on the previous page for the most  conventional way here.  There is another way though.  If you take Potash road (Utah 279) past Wall Street and Long Canyon to where it turns to dirt and proceed for 15 miles, you will reach the Shafer Trail/White Rim Trail junction.  Take a left, pass a  toilet, and go 13 more miles to a parking area on slick rock  beneath the towers.  Hike up the canyon, watching for a trail breaking off to the left and up towards the towers.  You have two choices here.  Either head for the notch between Monster Tower and Washer Woman (requires some easy 5th class climbing) or go around the base of Monster Tower if headed for the west face and "In Search of Suds".

description: The Three Penguins has a well-deserved name, although as one of my partners pointed out from the summit, the shadow looks more like a camel.  It is the first formation you notice driving up into Arches after going through the gate. 
getting_there: Park just past it at an indefinate turnout on the left side of the road.  You can do a chossy pitch directly up to the base of the formation or you can scramble up slopes to the right and then traverse back left on ledges (fast and easy).

description: Wingate sandstone with roadside (shoulder of the highway) belaying and excellent access from Moab with well over a hundred climbs from 5.4 TRs to 5.12, mixed sport and trad.  Actually too many routes with some contrived sport routes in too small an area, but worth a visit.  Gets morning to midday sun and in the warm season stays very hot until late in the afternoon.  Be wary of descriptions in some guidebooks; anchors have disappeared from some climbs, so carry a selection of trad gear on climbs where you can't see them.  Restrooms are available .3 miles N at Jaycee campground and .8 miles S of the Indian Writing sign at the south end of the climbing area.  This is a good area to get a feel for some of the climbing in the area, or if you only have limited time in the area.  Expect it to always be crowded, even in full-sun summer conditions.  Cool off and refill water later at the (potable) natural spring on the N side of River Road (turn E just south of the bridge on 191 as you head back to Moab, it's on the right in an obvious large paved pullout).  
getting_there: Drive north out of Moab on 191 and cross the bridge over the Colorado; continue 1.3 miles and make the left (south) turn onto Potash Road (279).  The climbing areas start about 4.2 miles onto the road (at the 'Park in Designated Areas Only' sign).  General parking is in turnouts on both sides of the road for the next mile or so, generally under the climbs themselves.  Use caution as 4x4s and trucks generally ignore the 30mph speed limit in the area, and tourists gawk and don't watch the road as they go past.  I personally wear a road guard vest while belaying to alert people that I'm not potential target.

description: Owl rock is a one pitch 100' roadside spire that offers one of the easiest summit spires in the desert.  Not that it's easy, but it's one of the easy ones.  Hint.  The rock looks like mud but really feels solid as you go up, and takes gear and slings well.  It's the most popular route in Arches (for obvious reasons), and worth a climb if you're starting out in the desert.  There is a scenic parking area 200' from the start of the climb to park in. 
getting_there: Go 9.3 miles from the Arches visitor center (entry fee $10 for a week) and turn right (E) on the Windows turnoff.  Drive 1.1 miles and turn left into the Garden of Eden parking area.  Owl is the spire ESE of the parking area.  Approach on established trails and avoid cryptobiotic soils in the area.  Gain the base of the route from the west ramp, not up the steps on the north side of the ramp (crumbly sandy with groundfall potential around 20').

description: The Captain. How can you properly describe 3000 feet of beautiful granite loaded with awesome routes? El Cap is probably the most recognized chunk of rock in the world to rock climbers. Climbers come from across the globe to challenge themselves on the 3000 foot walls of El Capitan. It's an awe-inspiring thing that first time you go to the Valley and stand at the base of El Cap, looking up. So much rock, so little time...  Note: When climbing El Cap, parties should come prepared for harsh weather with little notice. Rescues and even deaths have occurred over the years due to unprepared climbers that were hit by unexpected storms. 
getting_there: El Capitan is found on the north side of the Valley, just east of where highway 120 meets highway 140 coming in from El Portal. Can't miss it...

description: The Middle Teton is the 3rd highest peak in the Teton Range, and a familiar sight to all who climb the Grand Teton from Garnet Canyon.  Although easier to climb than the Grand Teton, it sees far fewer ascents.  One difficulty is that most routes on the Middle Teton are approached from the east up Garnet Canyon, so camp sites are by reservation and almost always full.  One-day ascents are popular for this reason, although they involve 6000 feet of elevation gain.

description: Want to climb the highest peak in the lower 48?  You're not alone.  While the permit process is a major hassle, the crowds are thin (until you summit), and the granite is as fine as it gets.  Most climbs are about 1000 feet tall on the east face that gets shady by afternoon.  Storms can brew over on the west side and give you quite a surprise.  There are two non-technical ways to the summit: the Whitney trail, a long slog up an easy walking trail, and the Mountaineers Route, a steep gully filled with loose rock, which is the usual descent route for climbers.  There's a decent campground at the end of the road, near the trailhead.  You must have a permit to camp anywhere beyond that, and they're not easy to get.  Call 760-873-2483 or go to the forest service's website.  Unless you're doing the Whitney Trail, you want a permit for the North Fork of Lone Pine Creek.  
getting_there: Drive up the Whitney portal at about 8,300 feet.  Lots of parking and bear boxes, where you need to leave anything with an odor that you're not bringing, including toiletries.  Most people spend the night at either Upper Boy Scout Lake (11,300 feet) or Iceberg Lake (12,600 feet).  Iceberg is the way to go if you have the time.  Incredible views of the mountain (and most routes), clear water right in front of you, and the climbing starts just a little ways up the scree slope from your campsite.  Getting there is tough and it's quite easy to get off route.  I recommend buying the supertopo and follow the excellent instructions there.  The hike can get really hot.  Start early (dawn) and you'll get to a campsite by lunch, have time to rest up and scope the route.  North Fork Trail Beta Trail begins off the main Whitney Trail, and is signed, follow the north side of the creek until you finally cross to the south past some very large boulders looming on the south side. The trail will pass rightwards beneath a large slab as it heads to a creek crossing to once again get to the north side and very soon afterwards the Ebersbacher Ledges, which follow a ramp eastwards, over an exposed step then back west to a treed terrace, from there the trail stays north of the creek up to Lower Boy Scout Lake. Cross the outlet and follow switchbacks up a large scree field through some very large boulders, and brush up to the sweeping slabs coming down from Upper Boy Scout Lake, which you don't need to reach because above the slabs there's a rough slope which leads you into the valley below the needles Day and Keeler (one of the most spectacular spots in the Lower 48). Traverse the north slope upwards until a loose and wet weakness/wide gully deposits you at the boulder field of Iceberg Lake.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/washington-column/105833399 
description: Washington Column stands at the eastern end of the Valley, on the north side. Supposedly, it was so named because from some point of view, the rock appears to look like George Washington.  The most popular routes on this formation are the South Face (5.7 A1), many climber's first-time big wall, and Astroman (5.11c), the world-famous free route on the east face. In recent years, other routes like Skull Queen (5.8 C2) have gained in popularity. 
getting_there: The Column is found on the east end of the Valley, just east of the Ahwahnee Hotel. It used to be you could park at the Ahwahnee and hoof over to the Column on the bike path, but I've heard recently that you can't park there anymore (permit req'd?). Maybe someone can post up the current beta...

Though there is not a huge selection of routes here, there are a few that are of high quality, one of them being Whale's Back (5.11-), a quality long corner splitter hand crack. 
getting_there: To get there turn off 211 onto the Beef Basin Road (left side of the road past the pond, 8.1 miles beyond newspaper rock). Follow the dirt road past two cattle guards. Do not take the right turn to Bridger Jack camping area, but continue the left trend toward 4x4 wall. At about 2.3 miles past the turn off there will be a parking area on the left side, which is next to a great camping area. Park right around here and to the west you will see the east facing stone that is the east end of technicolor wall.

Just a few of the quality offerings include: Edge of Night (.10c) and Secret Storm (.10a), Henley Quits (.10b), Doggie Do (.10a), Doggie Deviations (.9), Lancelot (.9) and Cid's Embrace (.8).  You will find everything from fun liebacks, fists, and hands to physical ow and wide cracks up at the Camp 4 Wall - you can have fun or scare yourself silly, depending on your mood that day.  The wall is southeast facing and gets plenty of sun until afternoon, making it a good winter/spring/fall spot, and an alternative for summer afternoons.  In spite of its proximity to Camp 4, it never seems to be too crowded, due probably to the general nature of many of the climbs.  An excellent place to build your skill set on all types of climbing.

description: Anywhere else in the world, a rock formation the size and quality of Middle Cathedral Rock would be a full-on climbing area in it's own right. It has the unfortunate problem of residing right across the road from THE ROCK (El Capitan), however. Still, Middle Cathedral has some excellent, long free routes on it that are well worth checking out. The most popular route on MCR is probably The East Buttress (5.9 A0 or 10c), included in the 50 Classic Climbs of North America. The next most trafficed route is probably Central Pillar of Frenzy (5.9), a nice crack line to the right of the East Butt (most parties climb five pitches and then rappel).  Warning: Some rockfall has occurred on MCR in the area of the Direct North Buttress (DNB) route and in the descent gully. Ask around for the latest scoop and watch your head! 
getting_there: Middle Cathedral Rock is the (surprise!) middle of the three Cathedral Rocks, found just south across the valley from El Capitan.  Bryan G. adds descent beta from the summit of Middle Cathedral: "There are several potential ways to get down from the top of Middle. The option which looked the best to us is as follows:  Begin by hiking downhill towards Higher Cathedral Rock. Heavy bushwhacking will be encountered. By staying near the left edge of the ridge (above Cathedral Gully) and with careful route finding we were able to make it down to the notch without too much difficulty. From here you scramble up 3rd class ledges and ramps with only minor bushwhacking until you're nearly to the summit of HCR. Then you can simply walk east and pick up the well-established descent trail which leads into the Spires Gully. **Don't try avoid scrambling up HCR by contouring east too soon or you'll encounter a ridge of 5th class rock blocking your path.   A couple other descent options mentioned in the Reid guide include:   -Descending slabs to the northeast to gain the Katwalk. Depending on the number of rappels required, this option could either be great or terrible, I don't know. It probably involves some fairly complex route finding in any case.   - Descending to the Middle-Higher notch, then hiking southwest toward Bridalveil Creek before contouring into the Gunsight. I'm pretty sure this is an ungodly bushwhack. Don't even think about it."

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/matthes-crest/106008975 
description: Matthes Crest is an extremely long knife edge fin that cuts across a spectacular part of Tuolumne.  It is sought after for its length, moderate grade, and the unique element of a huge fin traverse in an awe inspiring area of the country.  It is most widely known for its traverse, but many other routes exist on both sides.    The Matthes Crest Traverse is a true 5 star classic route characterized by mostly 4th class climbing with the occasional fifth class section.  With immense exposure on many sections it offers a rare experience to enjoy such a long moderate route in an idyllic setting.  Located in a region completely invisible to tourists or road traffic, it gives the true feel of a backcountry alpine climb. 
getting_there: Located in Tuolumne Meadows, Yosemite.  Park at the Cathedral Lakes trailhead along Highway 120.  Bear boxes and port-a-potties are available here.    3 miles on good trails and 3 miles cross-country 1700' elevation gain (2,300' total gain to top of Matthes Crest)  Head South down the John Muir Trail toward Cathedral Lakes.  After ~8 minutes the trail curves right and ascends about 30 granite rock steps.  About 200' after these steps there is a well traveled climbers trail that is blocked by a log (to keep hikers on the correct trail).  Follow this trail that runs along Budd Creek for a while then diverges right.  It is a pretty good trail for about 1.5 miles.  Cross a more open area of rock slightly right that is often marked by cairns.  The trail reappears.  Eventually you will see a creek crossing and the trail splits here.  Following it up the hill on the right will take you to Cathedral Peaks.  Instead cross the creek on your left across some fallen logs (very obvious).  Continue following the trail on to Budd Lake.  At the West end of Budd Lake, head South through a weakness by Echo Peaks.  Ascend this steep/loose section and veer left (East) around Echo Peaks.  Matthes Crest will come into view from this top section.  Head down into the valley and walk cross country to the South end of Matthes Crest.

Fairview offers steep crack systems as well as more typical face/slab climbing.   
getting_there: Park at the obvious pullout south of the road that is 3.5 miles from the store and 4 miles from Tenaya Lake.  The trail to the dome takes about 15 minutes to hike and leaves you near the center of the Dome.   Once you finish your route of choice, the obvious descent heads south down easy slabs to terra firma.  One then walks back along the base of the dome to packs/trail.  Allow about 30-45 mintues.

description: Like all rocks in the Lover's Leap area, this rock is huge, and an awesome (mostly) trad rock containing over 25 multipitch routes.  Climbing is, as usual, granite fun with excellent horizontal dikes everywhere.    One of the best things about this 350 foot tall slab is that it's the fastest to get to from the camping area, taking about 10 minutes from the parking lot. The base area is also very developed, the tiering that was put in by the locals obviosly took some time, and makes for an inadvertant crash landing a much safer prospect.  All routes decend off the rock on the right (west) side of the rock in a gully that has a switchbacky yet developed trail.   Climbing on the Lower Buttress ranges from slightly overhung, to slightly slabby, with large crack systems, knobs, and other features to help you on almost all routes. 
getting_there: Approach time: 5 - 10 minutes.  From the parking lot, head left at the fork from the parking lot.  Head gently uphill on the trail until 150 yards past the Monk boulder, which is the large 25 foot rock on the left side of the trail.  You will see the Lower Buttress, and will find the trail heading back at a greater than 90 degree angle heading over a 3' hump and around a medium-sized tree.

description: This area contains mostly trad lines from 5.6 - 5.11+.  Most routes are in the 5.8-5.9 range, and anchors are rarely bolted. This 400 foot face is the far left side of Lover's Leap, with very dikey vertical and slab climbing up faces and cracks.  There are a few additional bolts in place on the rock, but not enough to call any routes sport. This wall has the highest concentration of classic trade routes, making it one of the more popular destinations at the leap.   Almost all of Lover's Leap is featured granite, and for those looking for a polished Yosemite-like quality of rock, you should look somewhere else! The Leap and especially East Wall is covered in dikes, sometimes almost half a foot wide making routes that would otherwise be difficult and very steep into exciting and wildly exposed routes that go at typically moderate grades. You will find this rock in the sun in the afternoon, as it faces Northwest. This will make the rock quite hot on a warm sunny summer day.  You are at about 6,100 feet, which helps with the heat somewhat, but not with the sun exposure!  Almost all routes require a walk off the top, there is a convenient trail to the left of the East Wall. There is a spring running behind East Wall that has fresh clean and cold water bubbling out of the ground and running down hill alongside the trail. Please help keep this spring clean and do not use the bathroom or wash yourself off anywhere near it. 
getting_there: Approach: Total time: 15 minutes  From the main trail, head uphill (left at the fork just past the parking lot) about a 1/2 mile on the wide open rocky trail.  As the path winds, you will see many smaller trails leading up to Lover's Leap.  You should avoid the temptation of taking them,and stay on the main trail until it bends and is about 100 yards from the start of the climbing. The final path leading up to the East Face is very wide, and will take you to a side-windy uphill hike that takes less than 5 minutes from the main trail, and stays wide until just before the East Wall.  This path runs you right into the start of the East Corner (5.10d).

This is the gem of the Cascade Range and the most sought after summit in the range. Towering more than twice as high as any surrounding peak, Mount Rainier is an incredible sight! With twenty-six named glaciers, this is the most glaciered peak in the U.S.A., outside of Alaska.  Three summits rise above 14,000 feet, Liberty Cap (14,133'), Point Success (14'150') and Columbia Crest (14,411), being the true summit. Two overlapping craters exist.  The first ascent was made on August 17, 1870 by Hazard Stevens and Philemon B. Van Trump, by the Gibraltar Route.  Climbing Mount Rainier can be an serious undertaking, even by it's easiest routes. Severe weather can come at any time. Rockfall and hazardous terrain also exist. Be prepared!  The mountain has claimed more lives than all other Cascade peaks combined.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-bastille---n-face/105744723 
description: A mega-classic rock. The Bastille and, in particular, its North Face, is a cornerstone of climbing in Eldorado Canyon State Park.  According to P. Ament in High Over Boulder this was once called Chimney Rock and may have been named The Bastille by Stan Shepard in 1957.  This modest, 350 foot crag can be divided into The N face and the W face for organizational purpose.  The N face is steep, shaded, and has exceptional routes for intermediate climbers and advanced climbers who seek out the mental challenges in addition to the physical.  There are those who count the seconds attempting to set solo speed records here.  There is probably little for the lower end difficulty climber nor the high end climber here.  Once, the summit provided an anchor point for the cable upon which crossed Ivy Baldwin on many death-defying crossings of the canyon.  Today, the cable remains testament to a disappearing breed of adventurer.  Climbing here began at least in the 1950s.  There are legends of Frenchmen swilling champagne during an ascent up The Bastille Crack on French Independence Day.  Today, this remains a crag that holds a special place in the hearts of climbers who have progressed to climb some of the great walls and peaks of the world.  Amazingly, this face had some early high standard climbing with Stan Shepard and Allen Bergen freeing the upper 4 pitches of the Bastille Crack in 1957; however, the most amazing feat is likely Ray Northcutt's 1959 freeing of the Northcutt Start, 5.10d, after being told, incorrectly, that his competitor, Layton Kor, had just freed it.  This crag has been a proving grounds for some of Colorado's finest including: Layton Kor, Steve Komito, Pat Ament, Larry Dalke, Ray Northcutt, Dudley Chelton, Rob Candelaria, Roger Briggs, Kevin Donald, Jeff Lowe, Charlie Fowler, David Breashears, Duncan Ferguson, Christian Griffith, Mic Fairchild, Derek Hersey, among others.  Some of the finest routes on this face include: The Bastille Crack, 5.7;Werksupp, 5.9+; Outer Space, 5.10c;  Northcutt Start, 5.10d (likely Colorado's and possibly the US's first 5.10); X-M, 5.10d s; Northwest Corner, 5.11a s; Wide Country, 5.11a s; The Spice Tour, 5.11 s; & Hairstyles and Attitudes, 5.12c/d.  There are so many variations, linkups that it may be hard to list them all and unmotivating for most to submit these to the database.  Descents off the top traverse along an exposed-at-times break/ramp near the top to the N side of the rock and gain a 3rd class ramp down to the Fowler Trail.  From here, descend the West Face hiking trail (3rd class near the bottom) back down to the base.  A few of the routes have rappel descents, but they are the minority.  Come and climb here, but realize that many share your passion for the experiences found on this stone. 
getting_there: The most arduous approach in Eldo by far...At least a 1 min. walk from the parking lot to the West.  Once you enter Eldorado Canyon State Park, you will hopefully find parking within 200 yards in one of two areas.  Park.  Walk uphill to the obvious bridge across South Boulder Creek.  Look up and left.  This is The Bastille.  The N face is accessed off the road.  The W face is accessed off a 3rd class trail just around the corner and up the steep slope.

area_name: First Flatiron Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/first-flatiron/105744678 
description: The First is a huge Flatiron with many good face routes starting from the bottom to the top of the East side. It's probably the 2nd largest Flatiron overall.  The climbing is longer and more varied than the Third with huge flakes, dihedrals, and the rollercoaster ridge. Climbs range from about 4-10 pitches. Virtually every climb is a quality line.  There is adventure and there are crowds.  A 60m rope is nice for these routes, especially for the rappel.  On a rare winter, you can even find an ice climb here.... 
getting_there: From Chautauqua Park (W on Baseline, near 9th, off US 36), take the diagonalling "Chautauqua Trail" from the parking lot. At the trail intersection once in the trees, go briefly south (L), then follow signs (R) for the 1st Flatiron to the base. Depending on which route you're going to do, either take the wooden bridge to the base (routes starting near the nadir) or stay on the trail and keep hiking up the hill to the left to another trail that leads to access for climbs that start higher on the East face (e.g. Fandango).  Approaches range from 20-40 minutes for the casual walker.

area_name: Durrance Approach Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/durrance-approach/105714408 
description: This approach leads to Durrance and surrounding cracks.  Durrance is the most popular route on the tower, and it is usually crowded during summer months.  This area also contains the Wiessner offwidth, Best Crack in Minnesota, Rangers are People Too, Pigeon English, etc.  This area is primarily on the south side of the tower, so expect hot sun through most of the day. 
getting_there: Take the trail east from the parking lot and then take a right at the junction a short distance away.  Soon after, start heading toward the tower across the talus, taking the path of least resistence.  This is also the start for the west face approaches.  As you approach the tower, scramble up onto the southeast shoulder, and then depending on the route desired, follow this trail east around the tower.  Durrance is located around the tower a ways, and starts near the location of the ramp for the south and east faces.  Durrance can also be reached by following the approach for the south/east faces until the start of the ramp.  At this point, some scrambling/lower 5th class rock is required to get up to the base of the route and should probably be roped up.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/south-and-east-faces/105714384 
description: The South and East Faces both share the same approach.  The South and East face routes are very popular, perhaps because they end up at the meadows.  Once at the meadows, it is easy to top out.  The most climbed routes on the tower (besides Durrance) are on the East face, including Soler and Tad.  The South face also holds some popular routes, including Bon Homme Variation and Walt Bailey.  Most routes are 2 long pitches to the meadows, with Walt Bailey being only one pitch.  Rappel off the meadows chain anchors with two ropes for 3 rappels to reach the ground.  Also, some routes have their own set of rap anchors. 
getting_there: From the Devil's Tower parking lot, take the paved trail towards the tower.  Take a right when the trail forks, and follow this trail around towards the south face.  Look for a climber's trail taking off up towards the tower when you see a viewing tube (for looking at the old wooden ladder near Bon Homme).  Follow this good trail up to some slabs near Durrance, then climb up and to the right, following the slabs around the tower.  From here, it depends which route you are doing as to how far to go.  Some of these approach rocks are really slick, so be careful with heavy loads.

description: At 13,986 ft., Mt. Humphreys is the 14th highest peak in California. It is also ranked number 70 in the contiguous US. and one of 15 Sierra emblem peaks. The regular route is class 4.  
getting_there: Humphreys Basin: To get there, from Bishop, take Route 168, to North Lake. Past North Lake there is a campground. The Piute Pass trail leaves from here. Take the trail to Piute Pass. Five miles, 2,100' el. gain to 11,423'. From Piute Pass, you can see Mt. Humphreys to the north. Hike over Humphreys Basin to the base of the southWest slope, there are campsites at one of the numerous little tarns.  East Face Approach: The best approach is via Buttermilk Rd. off of 168. Turn right on to Buttermilk Road which is a dirt road. This road leads to the buttermilk bouldering area and is drivable in most vehicles. However, once you reach the Buttermilks the road quickly deteriorates. Drive over a cattle guard, there will be a left and right turn but head straight. Now the fun begins. Good clearance is highly recommended. Essentially you want to stay on the main road till its end. There will be turns and roads that branch off and it wont always be obvious which way stays on the main road. At 2.3 miles from that cattle guard at the bouldering area the road starts to curve significantly to your left. At 3.5 miles you reach a fork , go right. Drive through an aspen grove past some campsites drive over a small creek where the road turns hard left and heads up a hill. This hill can hold snow depending on time of year. At about 4 miles the road forks, go right, and then very quickly the road forks again, go right again. At 4.4 miles stay right, shortly after you see a turn to the right stay straight and then shortly after a left turn, stay straight again. Continue on and at about 5.5 mile you head up a steep winding section. Follow the road to its end in a small parking area at about 6 miles.

description: Intersection Rock lies at the crossroads of Quail Springs Road and Hidden Valley Campground.  Note that the road has been re-routed to the south side of the formation, which has led to some confusion with first-time visitors trying to mesh guidebook descriptions to locate the routes.  Tony Bubb: "On Intersection Rock, there are three main cracks running diagonally up and left from the base. These are visible from the North side (from the Hidden Valley Campground) and are called, from right to left, Right Ski Track (Upper and Lower), Left Ski Track, and Half Track These are plainly visible in the attached photograph."  At 5.3, Upper Right Ski Track is a rare starred beginner route.  In the 5.6 - 5.8 range, Mike's Books is a fun 2-pitch route (2nd pitch a bit wide).  Overhang Bypass (5.7) is a fantastic variation to North Overhang  (5.9) - both classics.  The Flake (5.8) is another must do.  Lower Right Ski Track (5.10b) and Left Ski Track (5.11a) will help to keep your ego in check.   
getting_there: If driving from the Park's West Entrance, park at the newly constructed parking area at Hidden Valley Campground.  All routes are easily accessed from here.

getting_there: Park in the Little Cottonwood lower canyon Park and Ride. Locate the climber's access trail in the lot's northeast corner (directly north of the restroom). Follow this trail east until you are directly below the obvious shaped Coffin Buttress.  The most enjoyable way to get to The Coffin is to first climb Crescent Crack (5.7, 2 pitches) on the Crescent Crack Buttress.  This lands you right at the base of the rock.  Another alternative is to climb a steep trail that leads to the base, to the right of the Crescent Crack Buttress approach trail.

getting_there: The Pentapitch area is on the south side of the canyon. The directions in the Ruckman guide (as well as older comments below) are wrong since a bridge by the pumphouse washed out.  After passing the pumphouse, continue driving up canyon. Just past Gate B, watch for the pullout and gated dirt road on the right.  Park at the pullout. Scoot around the chain-link gate and continue along the road going east for about 0.1mi. The road will turn down towards the creek (south). Follow for another few hundred feet to a nice wooden bridge over the creek.  Cross the bridge, and you are now on a doubletrack mtn bike trail. The trail immediately turns right (going west). Follow it for about 0.25mi, passing a giant split boulder on your right until you come to two obvious giant pine trees (see photo) off the right side of the trail. To your left will be an obvious path with stone steps. It will likely be muddy and might have a small stream running down it (see photo).  Follow the trail a short ways to a talus field. Skirt the right side of the field. At the far right corner of the field pick up a short trail (100ft) that goes straight up to the base of Pentapitch.  Approach time is about 20 minutes.

area_name: Schoolroom Area Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/schoolroom-area/105739413 
description: The Schoolroom Area covers the western portion of the huge Gate Buttress and is just east of the Green Adjective Gully.  As with most of the popular crags along the north side of LCC, the main attractions are hard face climbs and stellar cracks up excellent granite.  Over thirty named climbs and lots of variations are possible.  Some classic cracks in the 5.6-5.8 range are Schoolroom, Schoolroom West, Bushwhack Crack, and Hatchet Crack.   Most climbs descend from the Schoolroom rappel which is west-facing near the mouth of the Green A Gully.  From the top of the final pitch of Schoolroom or Schoolroom West, scramble down 30 or 40 feet to a tree with lots of slings and a few rap rings.  Rap down and veer left 60 feet or so to a pair of chains.  From here it is a solid 90 foot rappel to the ground&mdask;perfect for a 60m rope.  If you're using a 50m rope, you can scramble down from a ledge but be sure you tie stopper knots in your rope ends! 
getting_there: Park 1.25 miles up Little Cottonwood canyon.  Right now (2003) the north-side pull out is fenced off.  Go left (west) of the fenced pull out and you'll find yourself among the Gate Boulders.  Follow a trail to the left into a talus field.  Scramble straight up through the talus and eventually work your way along the west edge of the trees up to the base of the Gate Buttress.  There are several trails up to the climbs but this is what I found easiest.  The start of Schoolroom and Schoolroom West is at the left side before you go up around the corner.

description: One of the most stunning peaks in Yosemite, Cathedral is blessed with some great moderate climbing.  The approach takes about an hour and is long enough from the road and hiking trails to give you a little peace (often to be shared with many climbers - start early).  The summit is a small block big enough for a couple people to squeeze on.  Their might be bolts on the top, but usually not.  Downclimbing off the summit block can be scary, but John Muir did it in 1869, so you can too.  It's a great big lightning rod - get off ASAP if thunder comes your way.  Other than descending, escaping up and right is the usually possible until you get to talus.

People staying more than a couple of days may want to cross the creek and head up the glacier trail to primitive sites either below the Palisade Glacier Moraine, or on the Moraine (1.25 miles, 1,100 more feet of gain).

area_name: Tourist Trap Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/tourist-trap/106067797 
description: As the name might imply, Tourist Trap is a popular area not only with climbers but also with the passers by.  It lies right off the main "Moses Springs" trail, a mere 5-minute walk from the parking area.  There are a half-dozen or so moderate routes.  The most popular is Rat Race, an improbable 5.7 that surmounts an intimidating roof.  A single rope is sufficient to climb and descend all routes.  Route Index:  Pickpocket - 5.11b Angstrom's Away - 5.10a Wee Little One - 5.8 Rat Face - 5.10+ (TR) Rat Race - 5.7 Happily Married Bachelor - 5.9 Thrill Hammer - 5.8+ Nipple Jam - 5.8 
getting_there: Park at the upper lot on the East Side (the road terminus past the visitor center).  From here, hike up the "Moses Springs" trail for a short ways, perhaps 5 minutes, looking for a signed "Climber Access" post on the right.

description: Named for the historic plaque on the center its face, Plaque rock features 2 arete climbs and 2 face climbs crowded onto its narrow body.  Climbing is overhung on the face routes, and vertical or near vertical on the aretes.  The bolts on top provide opportunity to set up a top rope for the climbs beneath, but bring a 5' sling to ensure that your top anchor sits over the climbing, and isn't rubbing on the top of the rock.   The fact that the boulder is so small allows for all 4 climbs on the rock to be top roped without too much swinging.

This rock has a large solid metal pole set 15 - 20' behind the main face of the rock, which allows you to use long slings to setup top ropes on the 8 or so climbs (5.6 - 5.11d) on the face.  Be sure to bring long slings (~25') to this rock, as the top edge is quite sharp, and you want to ensure that your top anchor sits all the way over the edge to reduce / eliminate rope drag.   
getting_there: Looking at it from the road, Pinnicle rock is the most massive boulder on the left side of the climbing.Since the park is so small, it would be pretty difficult to miss it.

area_name: b. Jackie and friends Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/b-jackie-and-friends/107037580 
description: Major Features This popular section of cliff has a wide variety of climbing, ranging from the very-easy (Betty) to the classic 5.10s of P38, Stirrup Trouble and Matinee, and beyond.    The end of this section is the major left-facing chimney system of Big Chimney and Miss Bailey.  Those routes are just left of the lightning-bolt offwidth crack of Baby.  Approach : The trail along the base of these routes starts just a few feet past the vault toilet ("Uberpooper") that marks the end of the Uberfall section.  There is a trail up to the middle of this section just past the Black Boulder problem, and the last few routes are also reached by the trail leading to Baby.  Descents :  The Uberfall Descent finishes in a dead heat with rapping from the clifftop - you can walk off and be back at your packs just as quickly as rapping.  On busy weekend days, the Uberfall Descent is preferable - especially for the Betty and Jackie areas, where many intermediate ledges are strewn with small stones, and unsuspecting newer climbers are often below.  There is a set of bolts with chains at the ledge above the first pitches of Jackie and Classic.

area_name: a. The Uberfall Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/a-the-uberfall/107037539 
description: Major Features: The Uberfall is the first section of rock you encounter as you walk north from the steel bridge that separates the Trapps from the Nears.  On most in-season weekend days, a Preserve ranger is parked at the Uberfall, and it's a very social area.  Lest you think the Uberfall is named for the trickle (or, in season, the pouring) of water that descends down the escarpment here, Dick Williams wrote in his 1991 guide: The Uberfall acquired its name, according to Fritz Weissner in a 1960 Appalachia article, from 'the method used in the descent of letting oneself, with outstretched arms, fall across the four-foot gap between the massif and a huge block (Susie A) above the road'.   For our purposes, routes in this section include the beginning of the cliff -- the big whitish face you pass closest to, just where the carriage road takes a slight turn, is Katzenjammer.  We'll end the Uberfall section just past the striking, right-leaning crack, Ken's Crack. The very last route in this section is the corner system of Trapped Like a Rat, which starts with a left-leaning hand crack, just behind the kiosk, the Hans Krauss plaque, and is almost directly across from the vault toilet (the "Uberpooper"). The next section is b. Jackie and friends.  There are two landmarks within the Uberfall: the Gerdie Block is a huge block leaning against the cliff with the routes Herdie Gerdie, Dirty Gerdie, and Nurdie Gerdie (aka Dogs in Heat); on the block's right side is the short crack of Red Cabbage.  Just below the carriage road across from Nosedive is another big block -- the Mental Block.  It contains one of the Gunks' true crack lines, Sonja, and several other harder cracks, which face the road.  Approach:  Most Uberfall routes start almost directly from the carriage road.  A trail runs along the cliff between The Brat and the Gerdie Block.  Descents from most routes involves walking off; most Uberfall routes are single-pitch.  Closer to the very beginning, you'll be able to walk back and scramble down behind the cliff.  It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with the Uberfall Descent, which provides the walkoff for the majority of Uberfall routes as well as many beyond it.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/f-the-guides-wall-madame-gs/107051389 
description: Major Features: This area features the largest collection of easy multi-pitch routes: Beginner's Delight, Minty, Hawk, Madame Grunnebaum's Wulst, and Northern Pillar, among others.  For that reason, you'll often find local guides busy at work around here, especially at the short wall near the base of Finger Locks or Cedar Box.    This area starts with the huge, right-facing orange corner of Asphodel, and continues past Beginner's Delight, Snooky's Return, Minty, Hawk, and the area's centerpiece route, Madame Grunnebaum's Wulst, which aims right up the middle of the massive orange buttress. To the right, the area includes the routes just before, and in the alcove to the left of, the Mantle Block, a large block leaning against the cliff with a 4' roof extending across it.   Approach: Asphodel and neighboring routes can also be reached by the trail leading to Welcome to the Gunks. The main approach for the middle of this area is this trail,  which leads you right up to Minty, which you can recognize through the trees by the large blocks at its base (pic of trail will appear in the spring). Further north is the Mme G's trail.   Descent: There is a bolted rappel line on the rightnorth side of the Madame Grunnebaum's Wulst buttress; a bit of scrambling is necessary to get down to it.  Many routes also have intermediate tree anchors.  The bolts over Madame Grunnebaum's Wulst are a short, easy scramble down from the clifftop; they are located on the front side of a large block towards the front of the buttress itself. See the picture under the Mme G's route, which shows what you're looking for. "Back in the day", this rappel used to go from the large tree on the very front corner of the buttress, and getting into position to rappel was ... airy.  Even now, it's mostly free-hanging.  Two ropes will get you to the ground, or there are a second set of bolts mid-cliff for use with one rope.

getting_there: Climbers Accessing the Great White Icicle  For years ice and rock climbers have accessed the Great White Icicle and other south side areas by using the bridge and parking at the site of a small hydro-electric plant a couple of miles up Little Cottonwood Canyon.  In 2010 the current owner, Cottonwood Hydro, was forced to remove the bridge during a flood event that threatened the plant.  Since then Cottonwood Hydro has posted no trespassing and no parking signs to protect the plant operations and access to their private property.  As a responsible climber, you can help improve the SLCAs relationship with Cottonwood Hydro. Do not trespass or block the area and avoid the no parking and hydro hazard areas. Keep off the pipe, intake structures, and dam at all times!  During times of low water access the south side of the creek by using the recommended cross- country route shown in the map.  During times of high water use one of the bridges along the Little Cottonwood Trail provided by Cottonwood Hydro in partnership with the USFS. Bridges are located approximately ½ mile upstream or ¾ mile downstream of this location. When possible carpool from a Park and Ride to conserve the limited, available parking.

getting_there: The wall is located directly above the road approx. 2.4 miles up canyon on the right side (south side) of the road.  There will be a pullout there and a sign which reads "Remnants of an Ancient Sea." (Picture here.) Park in this pullout and follow the semi-obvious trail up to the wall.  (Five to ten minute approach.)  Another option, depending on the climb you are going to, is to drive a couple of hundred yards further up canyon and park on the right.  Follow a trail up and move to the right towards the wall using your best discretion.  This is a terrible scree field right above the road, so be careful.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-dead-snag/105739407 
description: With a short approach, long routes, and good rock this is a great area for beginning trad climbers, or a great place to just get out and cruise on a lazy day. 
getting_there: Driving up Big Cottonwood Canyon you will come to the Storm Mountain Picnic Area (about 2.8 miles up canyon).  Parking is up to your personal preference, along the road, a pullout a bit further, the picnic area itself.  Either way, the formation is across the road from the Storm Mountain Picnic Area (on the south side of the canyon.)  Locate the Storm Mountain Trail, follow the trail southward, after 5 minutes of walking (approx.)you will see the Dead Snag crag to the west, drop down to the right, cross the creek and make your way to the base.  Total approach time is about 15 minutes tops.  Alternately, Park on the right across from Storm Mountain Picnic Area. Walk back down the canyon 100 yards or so until you pass a rocky gully/stream on your left (there is a culvert under the road). Just past the stream, scramble up the steep rock steps into the woods to a trail. Follow the trail for about 10 minutes (ignore side trails) until you reach the cliff base. Parallel the cliff (going climbers left/uphill) past a small clearing with signs of camp fires until you get to the base of the arete where Sterots' Ridge begins.

area_name: Dogwood Crag Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/dogwood-crag/105739359 
description: Great area for the beginners (5.5 to 5.9-) with a few challenging routes on the eastern wall (5.11a to 5.13a). Almost all if not all can be top roped.  There are 5 bolted routes on the western end of the wall; 5.8 being the easiest and getting harder as you go left or east. Also on this end there are 2 or 3 sets of chains to set up top ropes, the climbing is probably about 5.5 to 5.7.  There are some trees you can use as well for anchors, bring long runners.  The harder climbing is located about 200-300 yards upstream or east. The hardest of the bunch, a 5.13a, is the only bolted route on this end.  The crag stays in the shade most of the morning in the summer.  Oblique, aerial photo here. 
getting_there: Drive about 1 mile up the canyon and you sill see the Dogwood picnic area on your right. You can either park in here for $5 dollars a car or if the stream is low enough you can drive another .15 up the canyon and park on the side of the road and just hop across the stream.

getting_there: Just past JHCOB Wall, hidden by pine trees, resides Narcolepsy.  Two approaches exist:   Scramble up the talus field at the lowest point and angle left to find loose trails, until you attain a gully that scrambles up steeply to the cliffs.  Park at Stairs Gulch and clamber up the steep bank, follow the trail west taking the right fork past Challenge Buttress and continuing west until you reach the gully and then clamber up to gain the cliffs.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/prune-face-slab/105739614 
description: A 100', moderately featured slab direclty downslope from the Five Fingers area of the Gate Buttress.  The five-minute approach makes it the shortest approach on the Gate.  The slab has five routes primarily consisting of classic slab climbing with the occasional groove thrown in for good measure.  The slab maintains a good angle over it's entire length and the moderate routes are relatively sustained, if not a bit under rated.  The top of the slab has a belay setup with one chain and one large hanger.  I'll work on improving this, as it tends to create excessive friction when retrieving the rope. 
getting_there: From the Gate Buttress boulders, follow the Schoolroom approach for about 50 yards.  At the first option to fork right (north), head up slope directly towards the Five Fingers area.  Do not succomb to the temptation to head right towards the dihedrals approach, but stay on a relatively straight "uphill" path.  As you encounter the beginnings of the buttress formation itself, then move up and left along the base for about 100' and you'll come to the base of Prune Face.

getting_there: Take the 3300 South Exit from I-215, and turn east.  Continue through the light at Wasatch Blvd, and then bear left at the first intersection.  There is a parking area at the end of the road.  From here, walk steeply uphill on a dirt road.  Turn left onto a trail towards a distinctive boulder just before a building and cell tower.  Head east on a path just before the boulder, and hike down the steep trail to the base of the wall.  The Iron Curtain Wall is on the left, and the approach takes about 5-10 minutes from the trailhead.

There are 13 routes on this wall, with some being multi-pitch.  Their grades range from a 5.6 traverse to 5.11d.  Some climbs can be rappeled, some require a 60 meter rope.  Still others need scrambling off.   
getting_there: In Storm Mountain Picnic Area on the NW end beyond the playground is a large triangular cliff.  Some of the climbs are approached via a ledge and 4th class scrambling at the base.  Others require a hike up to the west and are either behind the pedestal or further up the side.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/indian-rock/105734111 
description: Inner city bouldering at its best. This area is located inside the city of Berkeley, and elimination problems are the rule. Indian Rock is a locals' favorite because of its easy approach and accessible setting. It can be busy after 5 and on weekends, but if you've got a couple of hours to spare, it's only a few miles from the Berkeley campus, and set in a nice upscale neighborhood.   Rock is mostly smooth, but there is some sharper stuff on the upper area of the rock.   Super classics include the main traverse, and the watercourse area.   The main area is in the shade most of the time, though the tops of some routes can see some sun.   Indian Rock is primarily a bouldering area, but there are a few routes that you might want a top rope.   Descent off the top of the rock can be easily accomplished by walking off the back of most routes.   An interesting History of this rock will be added at a later point, when I have a little more information on the rock. 
getting_there: From the UC Berkeley campus:   Go North on Shattuck until it bends left and becomes Henry (which will turn into Sutter without you noticing). Follow it until just before the tunnel. Hang a right on Del Norte instead of going into the tunnel. Head up the hill to the Marin Circle. Leave the circle at the second right (the widest street you can take) and veer right onto Indian Rock Ave. Continue up the hill one long block until you see the prominent rock on the left. Park, and you're there. The main bouldering area is down the stairs on the right side of the rock.   From the North:   Take I-80 south. Exit on Gilman, and turn left (east) onto Gilman. Follow Gilman to a left on Hopkins street. Follow Hopkins up to the Marin circle. Turn right on the 4th street (the widest street leaving the circle), go slight right (and uphill) onto Indian Rock Ave. Head up the hill a long block until you see the prominent rock on the left. Park, and you're there. The main bouldering area is down the stairs on the right side of the rock.   From the South:   Follow directions from the North, except turn right on Gilman instead of left.

description: The Northeast face of Cragmont park offers several quality beginner routes, ranging from 5.5 to 5.10b.   The climbing is up a cracked slab, probably the best place that I've ever seen to bring beginners. There are 3 bolt top anchors on two different spots on the rock, and also a tree that would be good for an anchor on the far left side.   To set a top anchor, walk around to the top of the park past the basketball hoop. There is a rock wall that has a clearing with a path leading downhill in the middle. Follow this down 20 feet to bolts headed off the left of the rock. 
getting_there: Approach time: 1 minuteHead down the trail to the left of the bathrooms. The rock is about 100 feet downhill on the right side of the path, where the top anchors are easily seen.

description: This rock has a highway named after it, and it is paved right to the base.  Every route on this formation is extremely bold with massive ground fall potential.  Do not plan on climbing this during the day in tourist season.  Hordes of tourists will swarm the base.  Although, maybe a ground fall might land you on top of a tourist bus.  Climb this in the spring or fall and early or late in the day.    Many famous photos show people stemming up the middle of the eye.  However, the most popular route now seems to be a 5.10 route that starts directly from the parking lot.  To descend, rappel from fixed anchors using two ropes to the ground. 
getting_there: This rock is the main attraction of the Needles Eye area.  The approach is stepping out of the car and grabbing the first holds.  The crux of the approach may very well be fielding all sorts of tourists' questions.

description: These are the routes you can see from the parking lot.  They are all accessed by the west face approach and encompass all routes from the NE shoulder on the left to the large leaning pillar on top of the SW buttress (Durrance pillar) on the right.  The routes on the West face are some of the cleanest and most accessible routes on the tower.  Ultra-classics include Carol's crack, McCarthy's west face, El Matador, Tugley Wood, and many more.  As with the other sides of the tower, the "good" climbing is on the lower 2/3 with easy bolted rappels before the less appealing rock.  Most routes will require a two-rope descent.   
getting_there: Leave the main trail shortly after the trail starts heading south parallel to the tower, at the same place the Durrance approach leaves the trail.  Hike up the boulderfield to the base of the tower.  Locate the obvious stem box with two five-foot wide dihedrals facing each other for 150' and a ledge at the end of the left pillar  (El Matador).  Most west face routes are left of here.  Right of El Matador, see Durrance Approach.  Sparse poison ivy is often encountered on the hike/scramble north to Carol's crack area.

It is located to the left of The Folly and to the right of the Koko Ledge area (the large white slab) which was decimated by rockfall in the 80's.  Like the GPA and the Folly, Rixon's has a notorious reputation as a rockfall zone which scares away most of the crowds. Despite it's 15 minute walk from Camp 4, you will probably have the place to yourself.  Personally I think the rockfall hazard is somewhat overstated, but climb at your own risk. Here's a supertopo thread with some more opinions on the rockfall and some insightful history to boot. supertopo.com/climbers-forum/1...

getting_there: Upon reaching the Donner Pass climbing area, continue on Donner Pass Road.  On your right, further away at first, there will be an easily noticable wall facing the road.  After going over the small bridge, the road bends right.  A few pullouts later there will be a blue outhouse on the right, this is the pullout for Snowshed.  The path to the wall heads directly away from the road, across the stream, then straight to the north face (~2 minute walk).  Upon arriving at the rock you're beneath a boulder from which Bell Bottom Blues, Manic Depression and many other crack climbs begin.Navigating around the rock is rather straight-forward, its another ~3 minute walk to the left (around and up a big slabby piece) to reach the east-facing climbs.  On the east face, the super-sustained 'Little Feat' (5.10d) is located directly on the blunt arete facing you as you approach.

description: The most popular spire at Phantom Spires is the middle spire. It's easy to get to, it's got  a wide variety of routes (5.5 - 5.12) on terrain that varies from very slabby to moderatly overhung.    All the rock is frictiony granite that is often quite knobby.    As a spire in the middle of an open field, the rock is exposed to sun on different sides at different times of the day.  The West side can be quite windy, since the exposed boulder field heading down the hill grabs gusts and throws them up past the spire.   Kandyland (5.10c) is an awesome traditional lead using slings on solid huge knobs for most of the route.   All routes descend via rappel, as there is no really easy way to the top of the spire.  
getting_there: Approach time: 10 minutes.  From the main parking lot, head uphill to the west out of theparking lot on a moderately wide trail leading through the trees. This trail will wander up and down hillsides through a gully of sorts aiming directly at the Middle Spire, which can be seen at times. The approach trail will run into the Northeast corner of the spire.

description: An excellent crag that can be discerned by the multiple roofs that lace it.  The large roof on the left that is split by a hand crack/ OW is the cliffs namesake, the Gong Show. This area doesn't go into the shade till about 1pm in the summer and can be very hot on hot summer days in the morning. 
getting_there: Drive 4.5 miles to the Big Meadow campground and park (Please park on the road). Find your way across the stream and follow the climbers trail up the stream until it turns right and goes uphill. You should be able to find a use trail most of the way to the Crag. The trail ends just below Gong Show. Don't start up the hill until you find a good use trail.

Burns and Bach continued to the top and carried one of Putterman's shoes with them for a symbolic summit. In any event, this was the beginning of the era of the Putternan names that we now see all over the desert.

There is a trail from the old mine at the end of this road heading down and right. The mine is way cool to check out. Next time I would just head straight back on the main dirt road inside the gate, and then just turn left into the dried large wash and drive until the lower-angle gully is in sight and hike the weakness up to the wall where the wall (left to right) takes a left turn out for 80 yards and then turns left for the rest of the way.

description: Compared to the view from the top of North Six Shooter, the top of Castleton Tower might as well be buried under Lake Powell.  This is absolutely the most amazing summit I have ever tagged.  The climbing ain't bad either.    North Six Shooter is the northwesterly of two spectacular towers (the other being South Six Shooter) that come into view on the left when Indian Creek Canyon opens up, past all the established cragging.  It sits atop a massive talus cone and the east face offers one of the very best tower routes, the famous Lightning Bolt Cracks.  A series of subsidary summits reach to the south.  I don't know whether they have been climbed, but the southernmost summits in particular have some beautiful crack lines.    Lightning Bolt Cracks has cracks of every size with  comparatively only a little offwidth.  All the other routes follow crack systems that appear to have an inordinate amount of offwidth climbing.  The first ascent was made in the early '60s by way of the chimney between the main tower and the next summit.  It finished up a decrepit bolt ladder-these days, I'd sooner be bludgeoned to death.  To descend, rappel south from the summit into the aforementioned chimney/notch (check out the bolt ladder).  Then, rappel from three somewhat dubious bolts down the *west* side of the formation to the ground.   
getting_there: Drive west/north past Newspaper Rock and all the main buttresses to the Davis Canyon Road, around 14 miles beyond Newspaper Rock.  The road turns 4WD pretty quickly.  At one point you can follow a track to the right that bends around toward the base of the talus cone (the tower is west of the road, which curves back east after a couple miles).  Our guidebook suggested approaching from the south.  We attempted to do this and ended up following a line of cairns that led to horrifying 5.awkward soloing over the obvious white rim.  Instead, aim for a break in the rim further north, then follow the rim until below the east face, where a passable trail takes you the final hump.  Lightning Bolt Cracks and Liquid Sky are obvious above.

getting_there: Take Beef Basin Road away from the main road, past the Bridger Jack camping pull off and continue for a few miles until you pass a fence and cattle guard. A few hundred yards past this is a well-maintained road that angles back to the northeast.  Follow this to another junction and continue back the way you came (north) until you get to a gate and cattle guard.  Park here and walk through the gate (private land - keep a low profile).  100 paces down the road is an excellent trail on the right.  Take this up to the cliff (trail arrives at Rochambeau).

It is not technically part of the Mystery Towers (it sits far above them and is solid Wingate), but is included here due to its proximity and the fact that it only has one climb (to date). 
getting_there: A separate approach than the Mystery Towers.  Turn west off of 128 (River Road) bt. mile markers 29 & 30 at the Dewey Bridge Recreation Area.  Immediately on your left is the Historic Dewey Bridge and a parking area.  Reset your mileage here and continue on the gravel road west.  This approach requires a high clearence vehicle to get all the way to the overlook, but if you make it you could practically rap off your trailer hitch into the climb.  At 4.9 miles you will get to a well-signed junction (straight is the Kokopelli Trail, right is the Top of the World Overlook).  Turn right.  At 5.6 miles park you'll reach a fork with a long straight branch heading off to the right.  Do not take this; continue straight (ie the left hand branch).  You'll reach the Overlook at 9.0 miles.  The road gets steadily rougher, but I've seen a skilled Subaru driver take his wagon all the way to within 2 miles - not dent-free however.  A stock Cherokee or similar vehicle can make it all the way albeit the driver must know what they're doing.

From many perspectives, its odd geometry certainly looks like a priest, and you may wish you have one present if you aren't solid on offwidths.  This is my favorite tower in Castle Valley, and the summit is absolutely spectacular.  Honeymoon Chimney is the route to do, and a great alternative if Castleton is crowded.  The bottom part stays in the shade, so make sure you do this on a warm day.

description: Bubo Tower is a single formation with a single known line, in the Balanced Rock area.  The rock is typical of Arches, being somewhat soft sandstone, but not bad all-together.  The tower rises out of the sand vertically and the route Bubo is on the North Face, which faces Balanced Rock, form perhaps only 100 yards away.  The route is thus shaded and can be climbed in nearly into summer.  The Area is apparently a nesting area and climbing may be closed from January 1 - July 1.  To descend, rap on double ropes from the anchors up top.  The current condidition of the anchor is unknown- take some red/brown webbing with you.  In a pinch you could simul-rap from 2 60+ meter ropes, but getting the rope back could be difficult. 
getting_there: Drive into Arches N.P. and drive ~ 9 miles from the visitor's center.  Park at the large lot at the obvious Balanced Rock.  Walk the trail around balanced roack until you stand nearly directly between the Bubo Tower and Balanced Rock, then head for the North Face of the Tower, to the gaping crack in the center.  Avoid going off trail, as much of the soil near here is sensitive.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/mt-slesse/106108442 
description: The Chilliwack River Valley provides access to some fine alpine climbing, most notably Mt. Slesse and Mt. Rexford.  It is a beautiful place, and is heavily used as a destination getaway for swimming fishing and camping. Both Slesse and Rexford have numerous routes, none of which should be underestimated.  Access to the peaks is via forest service roads.   Mt Slesse lies at the end of Nesakwatch FSR which parallels Nesakwatch Creek.  In December of 1956, a TransCanada airplane slammed into the mountain in bad weather.  there is a memorial to the crew and passengers on the approach hike.  The wreckage and bodies were never recovered, and have long since been swallowed up by the Slesse Glacier.  Some debris remains in the area, notably the propeller of Propeller Cairn.  It is all protected and all artifacts must be left in place. 
getting_there: The Chilliwack River Valley is about 3 hours east of Squamish and Vancouver on Highway 1 (Trans Canada Highway).  Exit at mile marker 119 and go through the town of Sardis (south).  Chilliwack proper is North of the highway.  After about 3 miles one comes to a bridge crossing the Chilliwack River.  Turn left just before the bridge onto the Chilliwack River Road.  For some reason, this felt wrong to me when I did this, and we continued across the bridge, but the turn is in fact there, and missing it just adds time to the trip.  This road will provide access to Mt Slesse and Mt Rexford. For the east side of Slesse drive 30 KM from the Chilliwack River Bridge to just past the Riverside Recreation Site.  Turn right on Chilliwack South forest service road (FSR) then right again at the next junction onto Nesakwatch FSR.  Drive as far as you can on this road; we didn't get too far in a low clearance car.  The goal is a small parking area at a spur road to the right 6 KM from the main road.  This will provide access to all east side climbs, the Northeast Buttress Direct route, and north face climbs.  West side climbs are via the Chilliwack-Slesse Creek FSR, 21 KM from the Bridge.  Turn right and head up 8 KM to a large parking lot.  The trail from here follows an old road bed to a memorial, then turns and climbs STEEPLY to a forested knoll.  This trail and parking area provide the best descent from the Northeast Buttress route.  With the knoll being a reasonable bivouac for a fast party.  It is a long haul to the parking lot from the trailhead though, so plan accordingly.  We used a mtn bike to complete the loop.  Make sure you know how to get off the mountain before you go up!

description: High above Moraine lake sits Mt. Fay.  Looking southwest of the lake, the alpine ice routes running down the north face just begged to be climbed.  There are routes going up every side of the mountain, from classic north face grade III ice climbs to the technical Sans Blitz (V 5.5 WI 7).   
getting_there: From the parking lot east of the lake, take the tourist trail to the back of the lake and follow the climbers trail to either the Perren route or the Shiessler Ledge route to the Neil Colgan hut if spending the night or do as the locals say, Fay in a Day!    I have only made the approach using the Perren route, so I can only describe that one here: After the boardwalk ends, at the west end of the lake, continue on a climbers trail after crossing the creek that feeds moraine lake.  The trail will take you into a boulderfield with a medial moraine ahead and right, and a large wall ahead and left.  Head towards the wall and pick up the trail again.  This is what you will be following the rest of the way up.  The trail heads up onto a ledge system, follow the cairns and the most worn-out looking path to a chimney about a third of the way up the slope (an anchor is above to rap on the way down).  An easy scramble through this leads to another ledge system to a nice steady hill climb.  Eventually you will come to a vertical wall with a chain hanging down it.  Without using the chain, I thought it was a hard 5.7 (did it in the dark) and using the chain for holds, it's still a grunt with a large pack on.  This chain, 8 or so meters long takes you to a set of bolts, which lead to a bolted traverse.  At the end of the traverse (where you rap the cliff from) scramble up another 20 meters to the bench before the edge of the glacier.  Before you reach the glacier there are camping spots, which can be very windy at times, but you can find a water source.  Head southwest up the glacier to the hut or continue on to Mt. Fay, whichever path the crevasses allow.  It is said that the other approach route has potential rock fall hazard, and is only recommended in cold weather.

area_name: Mt. Temple Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/mt-temple/106997567 
description: Occasionally referred to as "The Eiger of North America", Mt Temple is perhaps the most prominent of the Canadian Rockies, pearched sentinel-like between Banff & Lake Louise, and towering over the picturesque Moraine Lake.  Temple's fortuitous location, dramatic appearance, and massive bulk make the peak equally well-known to climbers and tourists.  Its magnificent, sprawling North Face, over a mile wide and nearly 5000' high, is one of the few such North Faces visible from paved roads in the entire range.  At 11,636', Temple is the highest peak in the Banff Region, but is also one of the highest peaks in the Canadian Rockies, though its real attraction is its near-European accessibility and excellent, engaging routes of all difficulties.  The peak is comprised of alternating bands of shale, quartzite, and limestone.  None of these are particularly secure, though by Canadian Rockies standards, the classic routes tend to be relatively solid.  Perhaps the greatest argument against the Eiger analogy would be Temple's stable weather.  Located in the banana belt of the Canadian Rockies, the peak does not suffer the constant barrage of storms typical of Robson, Edith Cavel and other peaks of the Northern range. 
getting_there: Mt Temple sits prominently a few miles south of Lake Louise, on the west side of the Icefields Parkway.  To approach, follow the popular Moraine Lake road south from Lake Louise Drive towards Moraine Lake.  Trails depart from various points along the road depending on the route.

You can see it from Jasper on a clear day, and when I was a teenager I remember every store in Jasper seemed to boast a gorgeous photo or placemat of this peak.  I climbed the peak in 2003, and afterwards wanted to buy a nice poster of the peak.  Scouring Jasper I was disappointed to not find a single decent photo of this peak!  It seems its popularity has declined, or perhaps my memory of how great the photos used to be is poor.  In 2003 the tourist shops were chock full of photos and placemats with views from lake Louise and around Banff!  The mountain was named in 1916 for an English nurse executed by the Germans during World War I for helping people held captive to escape.  Among climbers, this peak is famous for its East Ridge, a classic moderate route with fantastic views, and its Nordwand which was conquered by Chouinard, Becky and Doody in 1961.  There are now quite a few routes up the North Face, and many argue that the original is not the best. 
getting_there: This peak is close to Jasper, follow the paved Mt. Edith Cavell Road to a parking lot at 5800 feet.  Here the peak soars over 5000 above you.  A nice short hike leads from here to Cavell Meadows, with spectacular views of the North Face.

description: Robson is the highest peak of the Canadian Rockies, a commanding 700 feet higher than the second highest in the range (Mount Columbia-12,294), and rightfully known as "The King of the Rockies".  Like all great peaks, there is no easy way to the summit.  The famous Austrian guide Conrad Kain, author of the first two routes on Robson, proclaimed upon first sight of the peak, "God made the mountains, but good God! who made Robson?"  This complex mountain has many distinct characters, depending on the aspect.  The North Face is known for its steep ice walls, the south side for complex, "gargoyle" studded rock & snow ridges, and the legendary Emperor Face, rising over 9000' from the valley below, for its daring mixed lines that push the limits of modern alpine abilities.    Although the "Wishbone Arete" was selected for Steck & Roper's "Fifty Classic Climbs of North America", this is generally considered a poor choice by Canadian Rockies & '50 Classics' connoiseurs alike, as a number of better lines exist on the peak.  Sean Dougherty, author of "Select Alpine Climbs in the Canadian Rockies" calls the line "...somewhat over-rated considering the amount of loose rock & the long approach."  The mountain's impressive size and intimidating vertical relief make one-day ascents uncommon.  Weather is a major factor in this part of the Canadian Rockies, and the mountain is said to create its own weather.  Some years the mountain may not be climbed at all, and in one 14-year period from 1939 to 1953, the mountain did not receive a singel ascent!  For routes on the South side, the Ralph Forster Hut is a key consideration.  Most North side routes will begin from a bivy at Berg Lake.  Most ascents take place from August to September. 
getting_there: From Banff, follow the Icefields Parkway (93) North ~285 breathtaking KM to Jasper.  From Jasper, head west on Hwy 16 (Yellowhead Hwy) for 85 Km, then turn right on an access road that heads to the Berg Lake Trail.  Follow this rd for 2Km & park.  All routes begin from this trailhead.

area_name: Snowpatch Spire Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/snowpatch-spire/105868064 
description: The impressive Snowpatch Spire is the most obvious spire when entering the Bugaboo's.  It stands just to the west of Applebee campground and is host to over 50 routes from 5.8 to 5.12.  The largest wall on Snowpatch is the east face with routes ranging from 12 to 15 pitches and almost all of them being big wall in nature.  The south, west and north faces boast numerous classic free routes such as the popular Snowpatch, Surfs Up, Kraus-McCarthy and Sunshine Crack.  Snowpatch Spire is also the most difficult spire to climb with no routes to the top rated under 5.8.      
getting_there: All routes on the west face are approached via the Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col located on the north end of Snowpatch Spire.  After climbing over the Col walk south to your desired route.  For routes on the north face follow the trail from the campground or hut toward the Col and north face is to your left once your in the Col.  The east face is obvious from the hut and the campground.  The south face is accessed via the Bugaboo Glacier.  There is a trail to the Glacier from the hut, but from the campground its fastest to just scramble over scree straight toward the Glacier.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/crescent-spire/105868074 
description: The Crescent Spire is located to the north of the Applebee campground between the Bugaboo Spire to the west and the Crescent Towers to the east.  It has numerous 5 to 6 pitch 5.10's with McTech Arete and Paddle Flake being the most popular by far.  Due to it's easy approach, short routes and bolted rap anchors (which you only need one 60m rope for) it makes a perfect crag for mediocre weather or rest days.   
getting_there: If approaching from the Kain hut the best option is to head toward the Bugaboo-Snowpatch Col but turn right before you get to the col and follow the Crescent Glacier to the spire.    From the Applebee campground walk toward the east side of camp and look for a trail that climbs north onto the moraine.  Follow the trail around the west side of the first lake you come to and around the east side of the second lake.  Then straight north up the Crescent Glacier.

And rightfully so, as it's most popular route, The Great Line, is absolutely that. Other routes also climb the face but no one ever does them.  
getting_there: From Fairy Meadows, walk to the base of the tower. A snow field must be crossed en route, but it's not much of an issue. It's about an hour hike from base camp to route.

I had a few friends that had done the route, but nobody seemed to be able to tell me where it was or how to get there...go figure.  Here's my best description...Gibralter Rock is the northern end of the shattered-looking ridge of rock that runs north-south between the Church Spires and Courhouse Butte. Up this rather questionably looking rock is one of the coolest moderate routes in Sedona, Four Flying Apaches aka Sedona Scenic Cruise. 
getting_there: Parking is at a long skinny pullout a ways north of Bell Rock. There's a sort of blockade/hitching post looking thing on the north end of this pullout. Hike north on the trail until you get to a bridge over a deep wash. Climb down into the wash and head east toward the rock, staying mostly right at the splits in the wash. Grunt up a hill at the end to reach the base of the rock and the route.

The two most popular are Tossed Green (5.10a) a nice thin crack and Crescent Wrench (5.10d) a curving crack with a difficult finish. Additionally there are a number of moderate cracks on the backside which despite having been climbed for many years have not seen any real documentation.  A novelty from the olden days is the "Valley of Trash", a collection of rusted cans, bed springs and assorted metal objects which lie in the depression at the base of the east face. Please leave these undisturbed for others to enjoy as they are protected by law.  This is a good wall to visit in conjunction with a trip to Baskerville Rock and/or the White Cliffs Of Dover as there are many excellent cracks to do in this area.  Routes from left to right  Direct Wrench (5.11a) Crescent Wrench (5.10d) An Eye to the West  (5.9)  Tossed Green (5.10a) White Powder  (5.7) Over The Hill  (5.9) Animalitos     (5.11b R) Animalargos    (5.11c R)

There is a ledge after P5 of the Lowe/Weiss route that makes a great bivy if you have a portaledge. The descent is a casual hike down a paved path. Once you top out, hike straight back and you cannot miss the path. The path is most exciting (yes, seriously) path I have ever been on. Try to save some daylight to enjoy the hike down.  It would be worthy of hiking by itself.  The descent is about 3 miles down.  —Casey Bernal 
getting_there: You can take the shuttle to the Big Bend stop (same as Prodigal Sun), or if you have a cool driver they will drop you off right in front of the trailhead.  From the shuttle stop, jog up the road about 100 yards to the trailhead.  There are trail markers posted to follow.  To cross the creek, look for a wide area with islands, and you can cross with only getting your ankles wet. The approach takes maybe 30 minutes.

description: This formation is a huge buttress coming in from the west side of the canyon. The Virgin River makes a long horse-shoe bend around it. There are many long wall routes here including Prodigal Sun, Ball and Chain, and Northeast Buttress (a free line).  The northeast face provides excellent shade for some of the morning and virtually all of the afternoon. There is a nice, paved trail on top for an easy walk-off. Check with rangers for possible raptor nesting closures. 
getting_there: Take the Zion bus or drive to Big Bend (when the Virgin River is low enough), or to Zion Lodge (when the river is too high to cross).  From Big Bend, walk down the trail to the river, cross it, and continue up and to the right along a marked climber's trail.  From Zion Lodge, cross the Virgin River on a foot bridge and walk to your right along the west bank until you reach the same climber's trail going up to the northeast face of the wall.

getting_there: From the Black Velvet parking lot, follow the old bicycle road west for a few hundred yards.  When the road turns left, continue west on a good trail.  At the base of Whiskey Peak, the is a trail branching left to climb up to Frogland and nearby routes; continue west, climbing slightly before dropping into the deep wash on your immediate right.  Follow the streambed up until it is blocked by a cliff band.  On the left side of the wash trails lead up to a steep 3rd class route through the band.  From the top of the cliff either go straight south toward routes near Dream of Wild Turkeys, or drop back to the streambed and continue upstream a short distance to the Epinephrine area.

description: This is the small summit on the left side of the canyon (in front of Black Velvet Peak from the parking lot).  Of course, small is relative here as its  NE face is probably 700' high in places.  Routes on this face tend to be quite shady and can be very cold on windy days, or in the winter. 
getting_there: Walk up the main drainage and head left ot the base of the wall, depending on the route.  Approaches to all routes on this wall are less than 1/2 hour, and many are popular.  For the many routes ending on the Whiskey Peak summit, the descent follows the obvious gully leading down to the east.  As you start the descent, wander left (north) on slabs to the left side of the gully.  Class 2 and 3 scrambling leads down to a point where a trail leads left out of the gully to join the approach trail underneath Schaeffer's Delight.

description: A great area with a fairly good selection of climbs, with most residing in the 5.11 range.  Since it faces due south it gets good sun all day long and is climbable on all but the coldest days - which also means a miserable experience if you go up there when it's hot.  While up there, you'll experience some of the best views in the region.  Most of the climbing is bound by two great routes - Black Uhuru on the left and Wavy Gravy (worth the walk) on the right.  In between lots of great climbs can be found, including the mega-classic Scarface. 
getting_there: Continue past the Supercrack area for several miles on 211 as it winds its way along the cliffs.  The large parking area can be found on the left side of the road just after a sharp left curve that goes into a long straightaway.  The lot is several hundred yards before a fence and cattle guard, about a half mile before the reservoir, and a mile or so before the Beef Basin road junction.  Due north from the lot, look up for the prominent buttress gleaming in the sun.  Find a good trail across the road and follow it as is dips into a wash before heading up talus to the base.  Upon reaching the base, the majority of the climbs can be found on the left.

description: Castle Rock is home to many of the classic climbs in Tumwater Canyon, and is home to Washington's first multipitch, technical rock climb (Midway, Fred Beckey 1948).  Historic climbs such as Angel Crack and Midway offer options for trad leaders seeking a range of difficulty from challenging to mellow routes.  In general, the rock quality is excellent though many routes are highly polished from extensive traffic.  Pitches leading to the summit of Castle rock can be somewhat indistinct and somewhat runout, offering an adventuresome feel on a well-traveled formation.  Castle Rock faces predominately southwest and can get a lot of sun.  The rock is split by Logger's Ledge, a wide ledge halfway up the formation.  Climbs on upper Castle begin from this ledge, which is reached by an obvious trail from the parking lot.  Climbs on the lower half begin near the parking lot.  To descend from climbs which reach the summit of Castle Rock, follow a good climber's trail off the back of the formation down to Loggers Ledge. 
getting_there: Drive approximately 2 miles west up Highway 2 from Leavenworth.  There is a large dirt parking lot on the "north" side of the road.  From this parking lot, a signed trail leads to Logger's Ledge and upper Castle Rock.  The approach is 10-15 minutes.

getting_there: The approach is obvious, but...  A little more beta for how to approach the two most visited parts of Cal Dome:   1) If you are climbing War of the Walls/Old Smokey area: drive over the bridge. Drive about a half mile to a mile, keeping an eye out for cement block with a metal pole on the left of the road. The trail to head up is about 10 feet before this landmark.   2) if you are climbing sands of time/silk road area: go beyond the metal pole landmark (maybe 100-300 yard more?) Look for a kerns right by the road. Follow the trail till it hits Cal Dome. Continue on the trail left to the base of Silk Road/Sands of Time.

description: Previous section: c. Moe (closure) to Harvest Moon  This section of the cliff is the most remote from the maddening crowds of the Trapps - you may be rewarded with a day to yourself over here.  It contains the Williams Wall, where a density of slabbier, more moderate routes might await you, roughly from Eowyn to the easy obvious splitter of King of P. 
getting_there: From atop the steel bridge, take the carriage road away from the Trapps, hang a left on the second trail to your left, the Millbrook Ridge Trail (blue markers). Next, head downhill at the four-way intersection about 10 minutes past that. Scramble downhill following the tags. You're really walking over, around and down the end of the Nears formation. You'll arrive at the leftmost of the routes in this section.  This overall approach takes about the same time to approach the far end of the cliff than it does to hike all along the bottom of the Nears.

Generally, routes are further apart here, with the exception of the Eastertime Too area, which has a number of high-quality routes within 100 ft. or so.    Navigational aides:  Coyote Crack, Whet Stone, Easter Time Too, Cherokee, Ambien Knights, White Pillar.  Dick Williams and friends went on a spree of new-routing in 2007 in the process of rewriting the guidebook, so keep an eye out for these newer routes (and carry ballnutz).  On the right side, this section starts with the large, orange right-facing corner of Eenie Meenie (not yet described here as a route).  Moe is right next to Eenie Meenie.  At the left end, Harvest Moon is the unmistakeable hand crack on the right side of a huge separate block that leans against the cliff.  The last route included in this section, White Pillar, climbs the chimney formed between the block and the cliff. 
getting_there: Keep on walkin' ....  ... but really, you should respect the closure and approach this area by the slingshot hike.

area_name: Redgarden - Lumpe to the top Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/redgarden---lumpe-to-the-top/105807704 
description: The upper or left section of Redgarden Wall is contained here and includes Lumpe Tower, Middle Tower, and the Hot Spur.  It is characterized by generally by somewhat lower-end difficulty routes with more broken rock in sections.  Protection and route-finding skills are mandatory here.  The routes remain moderate in length but definitely have a pleasant feel of adventure.  This section of Redgarden Wall includes routes from the top or left-most sections of Redgarden Wall to include Lumpe Tower.  To define the irregular Lumpe tower, we exclude terrain on Tower One, which we arbitrarily demarcate by a line connecting the obvious large dihedral separating upper Tower One & Lumpe Tower, aka The Dirty Deed, and connect this to the ground with obvious, West Chimney.  While this section may not be as packed with history as some of the other sections of Redgarden Wall, there is still interesting tidbits here like Larry Dalke just deciding to free The Green Spur in 1964  on a whim in Climb!.  There is also a fun video clip of the talented, Beth Bennett climbing Silver Raven in Front Range Freaks.  Some of the classics include: the fun Swanson Arete, 5.5; the beautiful Rewritten, 5.7; the zesty The Great Zot to The Zot Face, 5.8+; the fine Green Slab Direct, 5.9; challenging The Green Spur, 5.9; the desert-like Darkness 'til Dawn, 5.9+; the classic Grandmother's Challenge, 5.10c; the tricky Disappearing Act, 5.11a; the beautiful Silver Raven, 5.11d; the necky & controversial Paris Girl, 5.13a.  One thing to consider here is that some of these lines do not go into the sun until about 11am or 12pm.  There are few rappel routes in the area.  You can descend Lumpe Tower with rappels along the Swanson Arete and right area with a traverse, 3 double rope rappels to the ground.  You can also risk the rope-catching Dirty Deed rappel.  When in doubt, you can always traverse left at the top of the walls here to a 3rd class-4th class descent beyond the Hot Spur. 
getting_there: To access this section of Redgarden Wall, you should park at the east end of Eldorado Canyon SP, hike uphill briefly, cross the bridge. Here, for routes from Ruper to Super Slab/Doub-Griffith you may choose one of 2 approaches depending on your preference. You can hike either around either the L of the The Whale's Tail or you continue upstream, cross the concrete pad, follow the trail, take the right fork and you arrived nearly at the base of T2. For routes on the west side of Tower One in the vicinity of Vertigo and left, you should take the left fork (see above) and continue around the base of the Pickpocket Wall and catch the Redgarden Trail in the gully between Redgarden Wall and the West Ridge. This is labeled as a climber's access trail.  Continue up this trail.  Go right at the fork for Kloof Alcove area, ascend railroad tie steps, a small ladder, and find your route.  The obvious large chimney a short way above the ladder is West Chimney.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/i-high-e/107059022 
description: Major Features: Corners! Aretes! and more corners! Oh boy!  This section starts with its namesake route, High Exposure, which starts up a major corner and cleft, heads out onto the adjacent face, and ... I won't spoil the rest here. High E is one of the classic airy Gunks 5.6 routes that you'll remember the rest of your life.  Several other, harder classic routes nearby share the High E "money" pitch, including the Directissima arete and Directississima.  To the right of the High E buttress start the many corners featured in this section of cliff. Ants' Line, Bonnie's Roof and Groovy are three corners you shouldn't miss! (and if you like those, make sure you head to the next section for The Spring (P1)).  Uphill from Groovy, you'll find In the Groove, then the gully-to-chimney of Silly Chimney, which marks the northern extent of this area.  Past this, you'll see the yellow rock of the Yellow Wall.  Approach: The trail to High E scampers up in between boulder problems (pic to follow) - as you're walking down the carriage road, look for the Twilight Zone roof, then the next huge buttress over a roof features "The Move" of High E.  The next trail down heads up directly to Ants' Line, and can also be used for High E.  Descent: The High E rappel line was one of the first sets of bolts to appear, courtesy of the Mohonk Preserve.  It heads down the gully to climber's right of High E; three rappels with one rope (if you're linking the last two raps, watch the rope ends) get you to the ground.  It's a good idea to familiarize yourself with this rappel.  There is a set of bolts shared by the first pitches of Sleepwalk, Ent Line and Ants' Line.   You can also rappel from the top of Bonnie's Roof (two ropes mandatory - it's free-hanging the entire way) or Ursula (one rope from the top to a mid-cliff station).  The P1 anchor for Ursula, shared by Groovy is my least favorite in situ anchor on the cliff. It's webbing +/- rope wrapped around some very sharp edges; the fixed stuff has to be replaced almost yearly.  Caveat emptor.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/yosemite-national-park/105833381 
description: Yosemite National Park is it: The iconic birthplace of American rock climbing and the most famous climbing area in the world.    The park, located in central California, is home to both Yosemite Valley (THE Valley), Tuolumne Meadows, and several other less-visited climbing venues such as Wawona and Hetch Hetchy.  Climbers from all over the world have been visiting the Valley for decades (often staying in the little-changed walk-in campground of Camp 4) to test themselves against the great big wall climbs on El Capitan and Half Dome.  In addition to scores of historic aid routes, Yosemite Valley also has everything from long free climbs to world-class bouldering.  Don't expect a wilderness experience - the park is often overrun by tourists and climbers alike during the busy seasons.  In the summer, when the heat and humidity become stifling, Tuolumne offers a sub-alpine playground of beautiful domes known for run out slab and face climbs on famous Tuolumne knobs.  There are several campgrounds in the Park, the most famous of which is Camp 4.  Don't expect privacy or quiet, but do expect tons of climbers and being located right in the center of the action.  Camp 4 is a walk-in campground and lines will form each morning before the sun rises for openings.  Most of the other sites (such as the Pines and the Tuolumne campground) are reservation campgrounds which fill up months in advance.  Stays are limited from one month down to one week depending on the season.   Hipcamp has a great directory of the campgrounds, and for some of them you can even check availability and book them online. 
getting_there: Driving  From points west (San Francisco Bay area): Highway 120 and 140 lead into the park and Yosemite Valley.  120 continues east to Tuolumne Meadows and then drops down to the East Side of the Sierra via Tioga Pass.  From the south (Fresno): Highway 41 leads into the park past Wawona and into the Valley.  From the east (Bishop, Mammoth, Reno):  During the summer months highway 120 can be followed west up over Tioga Pass and into Tuolumne Meadows and then down to the Valley.  Tioga Pass is frequently closed from mid-October to late-May.  Mass Transit  Yosemite roads are crowded!  Consider YARTS, the only public transit to Yosemite National Park. Its buses run seasonally from Merced, Mammoth Lakes, Sonora, and Fresno to Yosemite Valley and Tuolumne Meadows The fare is included in your park entrance fee.    To reach YARTS connecting cities, you can ride an Amtrak train (amtrak.com).  Amtrak connections can be made from the San Francisco Bay Area airports using BART (local train, bart.gov) to Richmond Station (or several others that connect to Amtrak trains).

description: Yosemite Valley is THE PLACE for many rock climbers. A literal mecca for climbers across the globe, the crags and walls of "The Valley" see thousands of climber-days in the course of a year. During the height of the season, it's typical to hear climbers on El Capitan yelling back and forth in English, German, Japanese, Russian and many other languages. In this one place, many factors come together to form a nearly perfect arena for rock climbing; mild weather, beautiful scenery, and incredible granite walls perfectly suited to climbing. On a rest day, visit the many tremendous waterfalls, hike some of the beautiful trails, and breathe in one of the most incredible places in the entire country.  
getting_there: Yosemite Valley can be reached from the west, south or east via highways 120 (west), 140, 41 or 120 via Tioga Pass. The Tioga Pass drive through Tuolumne Meadows from the east side is normally closed from sometime in the fall through mid to late May due to snowfall.  Traffic is an ongoing issue with Yosemite Valley during the tourist season. On especially busy days, cars are even stopped from entering the park once its determined that capacity has been reached. Plan accordingly.

There are hundreds of routes on dozens of crags scattered throughout the length and on either side of the canyon.  Climbing is primarily on quartzite, which tends to be slippery and hard; however, the quartzite also offers numerous holds jutting out at all angles. Because protection may be more difficult in quartzite than in the granite of LCC, BCC has more sport routes than LCC, but the majority of BCC routes are trad climbs.  Some of the picnic areas have entrance fees.

area_name: Eldorado Canyon SP Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/eldorado-canyon-sp/105744246 
description: As one of the world's finest and most famous climbing areas, Eldorado Canyon needs little introduction.  It consists of steep, beautiful conglomerate  sandstone walls of up to 700 feet high, in brilliant shades of gold and red. The rock quality is reminiscent of granite rather than the soft sandstone found throughout much of Utah and Arizona.   The largest cliff, Redgarden Wall , is a few thousand feet wide; it boasts several spectacular summits and an incredible collection of classic climbs.  Many of the classic routes were  put up in the 1960s by Layton Kor, along with climbers such as Pat Ament and Larry Dalke.  The 1970s were primarily a time of first free ascents,  spearheaded by climbers such as Steve Wunsch, Roger Briggs, Jim Erickson, and Duncan Ferguson.  New activity tailed off a bit in the 1980s, though some very good routes were established.   Climbing in Eldorado Canyon can be odd and it requires some getting used to. It is primarily a traditional area, yet there is relatively little crack  climbing.  Friends of mine who are used to Lumpy Ridge think everything in Eldo is a sandbag, but once I got used to Eldo I started to feel more secure there than at Lumpy Ridge.  Individual pitches will often require delicate face  climbing and some kind of funky, inobvious traverse.  Highly technical moves separated by decent rests are quite common.  Old fixed gear is an Eldo staple, and can either add or subtract spice from your route depending on its quality and the availability of other pro.  It enables routes such as the The Yellow Spur and the West Buttress of the Bastille (both 5.9) to offer pro-at-your-waist cruxes.  On the other hand, you just know that those pins at the cruxes of climbs like Tagger (5.10) and the The Naked Edge (5.11) are not going to hold too many more 10 foot falls. One should really back up most pins whenever possible.  Ultimately, skill in placing pro is very important;  cracks tend to be discontinuous and incipient, and nearly all the "sport" routes require some gear as well.    Must-do beginner routes include Wind Ridge and Calypso (both 5.6) on Wind Tower.  They are both a bit awkward in spots.  In the 5.8 range, Ruper on Redgarden Wall and The Bastille Crack top the list.  The Bulge (5.7+) on Redgarden is quite runout, but also excellent.  Many people feel that The Yellow Spur (5.9) on Redgarden Wall is the best route in the Canyon.  Other great routes at that grade include the West Buttress and Hair City (Bastille), Anthill Direct and The Green Spur (Redgarden Wall), and the The Unsaid (The West Ridge).  5.10 classics are everywhere; my personal favorites are Rosy Crucifixion (10a) and Outer Space (10c).  Over the Hill (10b), Super Slab, Grandmother's Challenge, and Tagger (all 10c) are also great, as are many, many other routes at the grade.  5.11 offers some world-renowned classics  like the The Naked Edge, Vertigo (11b), and the Northwest Corner of the Bastille (11a).  5.12 (which I have no experience with personally) seems to offer either very scary climbs such as Scary Canary (12b) or very safe climbs such as Your Mother. (12d).  5.13s are fairly rare, due to bolt restrictions, but some historic classics such as Desdichado and Rainbow Wall do exist.  Addendum: A trad 5.14, Iron Monkey (freeding Lycra-Clad Donkeys), has been established.  The aforementioned Redgarden Wall holds the longest routes, but also offers great one-pitch climbs, [particularly] a little ways up the trail at a long slanting roof.  The Bastille is a 350 foot high vertical cliff which rises right out of the road and offers very steep climbing.  The The Wind Tower is the place to go for great beginner climbs as well as scary 5.10 routes, and the The West Ridge/Rincon offers the best concentration of one pitch routes of all grades -- usually very aesthetic crack and corner climbs.  Obscure outlying areas such as Cadillac Crag, Shirt Tail Peak, and the Peanuts Walls have excellent climbing, but also involve longer approaches.    Eldo can be a very confusing place and it is helpful to at least look at a guidebook, such as Steve Levin's newest guidebook, Eldorado Canyon, A Climber's Guidebook, or Richard Rossiter's out of print, comprehensive Rock Climbing Eldorado Canyon.  Fred Knapp's Classic Boulder Climbs is about a third the cost, and still has most of the best routes as well as other great routes around Boulder.    Ideally, a traditional climber's road trip to Boulder should include a day at Eldo followed by a day at Lumpy Ridge (45 minutes from Boulder)-- both offer fantastic climbing, but it is hard to imagine two more different styles.  Of course, if experience permits, the alpine rock climbs in nearby Rocky Mountain National Park are not to be missed, either.  One can climb in Eldo at any time of year, though summer is piping hot and slick while winter is inconsistent. 
getting_there: From Denver, head N on I-25 to US 36, go to the CO Hwy 170 exit.  Follow it as it curves around a new shopping complex, and go past CO Hwy 93 to the town of Eldorado Springs and to the state park.  From Boulder, take CO Hwy 93 (Broadway) South until you get to the first stop light after leaving Boulder. This is Eldorado Springs Dr. Take this West until you hit the town. The park entrance is at the end of the dirt road into town. Pay entry fee per vehicle to park or walk-in for less. You WILL be ticketed if you park in undesignated spots outside of the park....  The Eldorado Springs bottling company is right off the road to the park. You used to be able to get a free fill-up on your water bottle, but now it's a pay deal. What a rip, man.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-wind-tower/105807505 
description: This popular rock can be divided in character into its south and southwest face.  The SW face has some of the most frequently climbed routes in Eldorado Canyon and is probably the best area in Eldorado Canyon for those seeking lower end difficulty climbing.  The rock is stellar for the first two pitches of climbs on this face.  Above this the rock has seen less traffic and still has loose rock for the unsuspecting climber.  On its S face, you will find fewer companions since its vertical face and spartan protection options will deter all but the most ardent suitors.  Once, the summit provided an anchor point for the cable upon which crossed Ivy Baldwin on many death-defying crossings of the canyon.  The cable was taken down in 1974.  Today, the cable remains testament to a disappearing breed of adventurer.  These are some of the earliest stomping grounds for Colorado legends like Layton Kor, Dick Bird, Dallas Jackson, Cleve McCarty, Larry Dalke, Pat Ament, Jeff Lowe, Jim Erickson, Steve Wunsch, Kevin Donald, Charlie Fowler, Duncan Ferguson, Kyle Copeland, Dan Hare, Mike Brooks, Richard Rossiter, and others.  Ultra-classics include: Calypso, 5.6; Wind Ridge, 5.6; the slippery Tagger, 5.10c;  Metamorphosis, 5.9+ s; King's X, 5.11a s; and Rainbow Wall, 5.13a.  The low part of this wall does include some moderately popular bouldering and traversing.

getting_there: Once you enter Eldorado Canyon State Park, you will hopefully find parking within 200 yards in one of two areas.  Park.  Walk uphill to the obvious bridge across South Boulder Creek.  Cross the bridge.  Look up & right.  Follow the trail to the SW face or veer right to the S face.

description: The Flatirons are synonymous with Boulder and the history of rock climbing in North America. It would be hard to find another location in the country where such an extensive variety, from scrambling to hard "Head Point" routes exist so close to a major metro area. They form the backdrop to Boulder and are the centerpiece of Boulder's Open Space system.  There are three main areas:  Flatirons North This area includes classic rocks such as the First and Third Flatirons, and the Amphitheatre in Gregory Canyon. Climbs here range from short newer-age sport climbs to long trad routes, including some of the longer trad routes in the area, the whole face of the 3rd Flatiron, which is about 1300 feet and the Direct East Face of the 1st which is about 1400 feet. Hard conglomerate Fountain Formation sandstone is the medium for your rock craft.  Flatirons Central There are many rocks to explore in this area. The "Central" zone spans Bear Canyon to the Ironing Boards (just South of the 3rd Flatiron). Slabmongers can have many field days exploring the numerous smaller Flatirons, and there's a good amount of trad and even sport among these rocks. Have fun in this scenic setting.  Flatirons South This section of the Flatirons holds some of the best climbing in the Flatirons, but it seems to be less crowded. Great rocks such as the Maiden, Matron, Devil's Thumb, East Ridge, Nebel Horn, Seal Rock, and The Goose offer slabs for beginner trad leaders and also more challenging trad lines. Excellent sport routes also can be found, some several pitches in length. The longest climb in the area is here.  There is plenty to explore here.  Access: Various of the Flatirons are closed for falcon nesting from Feb. 1 up to July 31 and for bat nesting Apr. 1 to Aug. 31. Historically, some of these have included The Matron, Towers of the Moon, Jam Crack Spire, Devil's Thumb, Nebel Horn, Jaws, The Fin, Sphinx, Medusa, Fern Canyon, The Goose, The Goose Eggs, Bear Creek Spire, Harmon Cave (bats), East Face of The Hand (bats), East Face of The Finger Flatiron (bats), East Face of Der Zerkle (bats), Dreadnaught, Achean Pronoucement, Skunk Canyon Ridge 2 & west, Sacred Cliffs, East & West Ironing Boards, The Third Flatiron, Queen Anne's Head, occasionally Gregory Amphitheatre, and possibly others.  Please check with city of Boulder Open Space & Mountain Parks at 303-441-3440 before heading up there.  Also, 303.441.4060 ext 420 & x 416 can provide information. 
getting_there: Look west of Boulder, if you can't see them you shouldn't go climbing...although, it can be amazingly beautiful with liquid or solid precipitation falling. Seriously, there are numerous trails and parking lots depending on which crag you are visiting, so please refer to these descriptions.   A word of warning though; the first time climbing in the Flatirons can be a confusing experience, with lots of trails, crags and rocks that look very similar so allow plenty of time for exploring and pick a major feature to climb.

description: This is a separate section of Colorado, since you, the user of mountainproject.com, have asked for it.  To help you find all that your icy heart desires, look  here.  Though not organized by town or city, this section is organized  geographically.  Here, you will find the subset of climbing done with crampons & ice tools on at least some bits of ice.  In this Colorado medium, you will find amazing beauty, ethereal sculptures created by nature, and a different peace than when you don sticky rubber and dab fingers into your chalkbag.  You will dig deep, you will find ascents unique to each passage, and you may find a reward for balancing mind, body, and respect for the cold, natural world.  Those of you drawn to this aspect of the sport will search far and wide for some new, undiscovered dribble of the frozen variety.  You will tramp all day based upon a narrow set of topographical lines on a map, drive hours based upon a rumor, drag half your weight in gear up miles of unpacked trails just looking for that next line.  You'll call friends, call friends of friends, squeeze climbing shop employees for conditions, and scan websites for updates on climbs.  Hopefully, here you will find something useful, consider adding routes to the database, update conditions for your fellow ice climber, and contribute to this small but growing database.  Please do not take offense to those who seek to share...for we all love this medium...it is a passion.  For those of you out there who long for the day when no one else but you and your partner were out there whacking away, please remember when this was your new found focus.  Also, understand by adding to this information, we spread folks out to allow a better experience for all.  So, here find your information on areas like Ouray, Lake City, Rifle, Vail, Mt. Lincoln, Wolf Creek Pass, Telluride, Glenwood Canyon, Clear Creek Canyon, Big Thompson Canyon Ice, St. Vrain ice, Colorado Springs, Durango, Silverton, Redstone, Coal Creek, Officer's Gulch, Parachute, Royal Gorge, Grand Junction, Gunnison, Rocky Mountain National Park and, maybe some day, Willow Lakes (thanks!, George).  You will find lines from quick, ice-bouldering sessions to all day affairs, from 12 to 1500 feet, from roadside to backcountry.  For the exploring types, there are still ice climbs to be done out there...even depicted in this database.  There are even rumors of Poudre Canyon ice.  There will be climbs that have been done where it is unlikely that someone will post it here due to lack of legal access, promises of secrecy, and fading in aging memory banks.  For those, you'll just have to root around a bit or do it the old fashion way, earn it.  In really moist winters, amazing lines will pop up all over the place, even in predominantly rock climbing areas!  So, keep the mind open, the eyes on alert, and the imagination in gear.  At the moment, this is a work in progress to reorganize this database for the subset who seek out the cold....  Please be patient. 
getting_there: To get there, you will search far and near, high and low.  You will drive, hike, scramble, and toil towards your goal.  Approaches will vary from 1 minute to 1 day.

description: A good mixture of climbing abounds. There are trad lines up to three pitches, great slabby routes, and offwidths (ouch!).  There is an entrance fee for the Central Area and for Lower Blair (if you park in front of Blair III). Otherwise, access to the crags is free. The fee areas are Federal land, so Golden Eagle and Golden Age passes are accepted.  The camping, once totally free in the surrounding areas, has become more restricted. There is a fee campground in the Central Area with tables and outhouses. Otherwise, free camping is permitted wherever it's not explicitly prohibited. Laramie is a college town with some local brew and dining available a mere 10 miles away. There are a great number of moderate classics as well as some stiffer grades for the big guns out there. There are areas right off the road and some more remote where you'll have little company. Most formations have walkoffs, but rap bolts are fairly prevalent.  Super must do classics include: Edward's Crack 5.7 (2 pitches), Kim 5.6, Friday The 13th 5.11a, 5.11 Crack 5.9+, MRC Direct 5.9.

description: Downstream from the Yosemite Valley, but still inside the park boundaries, there are numerous rocks that are mostly less famous, and therefore somewhat less crowded, than the legendary areas to the east.  I followed Don Reid's Yosemite guide sections to put this page together.  Bryan G shared these excellent notes on how the crags fit together.  "And here is rough approximation of what the left/right sorting would be. First, the north side starting at El Portal running east:   Parkline Slab  Narrow Escape Cliff  U.S.G.S. Wall  Arch Rock  Short Circuit Boulder  Finger Lickin' Area  Roadside Attraction  Kat Pinnacle  Sunshine Cliff  Cookie Cliff, The  Cookie Sheet, The  Wildcat Falls & Above the Cookie  Knobby Wall  Cascade Area  Knob Hill  Owl, The  This and That Cliff  Generator Station  New Diversions  Goldrush  Reed's Pinnacle Area  Five and Dime Cliff  Mojo Tooth Area, The  Highway Star  Last Resort Cliff   Then the south side as you move down canyon:   Pulpit Rock  Wawona Tunnel  Wawona Tunnel West  Cream  Rostrum, The  Jungle Gym, The  Elephant Rock  Hand Out Cliff   It's not a perfect geographical representation because I tried to clump some areas together which have a similar approach. This and That, Generator Station, and New Diversions are all approached from the 140 so I think it's better to list them in a sequence, even though Goldrush is technically between them. Hope this helps." 
getting_there: On both sides of the Merced River, between Mariposa and the Valley. Many of these areas are reached from State Route 140, which parallels the river, but some areas are easier to reach from other roads.

area_name: High Sierra Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/high-sierra/105791817 
description: John Muir's Range of Light...  Deep forested valleys, pristine lakes, beautiful meadows, acres of suncups, huge walls and domes, jagged ridges leading up to windswept nameless summits; all these await you.  Some of the finest granite, most beautiful mountains, and stable weather make the High Sierra a special place for climbers.  Though there are some long monolithic faces (like Charlotte Dome), the majority of climbing is on high altitude mountain walls which follow crack systems.  Frequent ledges make for comfy belays.  Routes frequently wander a bit, but pro is usually not a problem, and long slings can often be used to tie off a feature and keep the drag down. Of course like all mountain big walls, there are loose blocks, boulders, and rocks on the ledges, so take care with the ropes.  Despite the crowds in a few places, the dreaded permit system means the climbs are uncrowded, the camping is pleasant, and you feel like you've gotten away from it all and found some true wilderness.  In fact some parts of this range are incredibly far from the madding crowd, seek these places out, they are ancient and sacred places. For every crowded classic (a result of the "select" books?) there are a hundred empty just as classic routes.  Some notes about the weather/conditions:-  May-June: Approach to climbs may require taking crampons and ice-axe. Snow can provide a good highway there and back. May and June provide long daylight hours. Weather can be unstable with late arriving winter storms. Cold to cool.  July-Early Aug: Not so much snow, unless it's a big snow year. Suncups begin to develop which can hamper approaches. Still lots of daylight. Stable weather. Mosquitos. Warm.  Mid August - Mid September. No snow, more scree. Late afternoon thunderstorms. Hours getting shorter. Warm to cool.  Mid September - Late October: First winter snow. Less and less hours of daylight. October can be nice though, but not for long climbs. Cool to cold.  Interesting reading from the Ranger Reports. 
getting_there: The High Sierra runs from the Sawtooth Range in the north, south to the Whitney Group, and covers an area bigger than the entire European Alps - most of it wilderness.    The easiest access is from Highway 395 on the east side, where several roads (thanks FDR) terminate at 7,000-10,000 foot trailheads within a few miles of the peaks, there are also options to cross high passes to access west country.  There are also approaches from the west side, they are very beautiful and they tend to be longer and less steep, these are more useful for peaks or crags on the west side.  From the bay area, Highway 120 through Yosemite is the fastest route, even if you're going all the way to Whitney.  If you leave after work, you can stop in Tuolumne Meadows (8,800 ft) or one of the Forest Service campgrounds just beyond the park (from 7,000-9,000 feet, and a bit cheaper).  All these campgrounds will be full on summer weekends starting in July, but you can reserve sites in Tuolumne Meadows.  From Los Angeles take Highway 14 to 395 for the east side approaches. For the west side approaches take Freeway 5 then Highway 99.  If you're from out of town, you might find a good deal flying to Reno and renting a car.  Most people backpack and camp before climbing a specific route, and that requires an permit on almost all trailheads.  Some are pretty hard to get, and you'll need to plan months ahead. A certain number are available on a first-come first-served basis on the day of the hike, if you don't mind starting late.  Permits  For the Inyo and Hwy 395 approaches go here. For the Sequoia/Kings Canyon backcountry approaches go here. For Yosemite backcountry approaches go here.  NOTE: There are a small amount of permits available on a first-come, first-served basis at the applicable Ranger Stations.   The permit info here supercedes any info at the peak level.  Areas are listed from North to South (01 to 13)

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/13---whitney-and-surrounding-peaks/110503166 
description: The Mount Whitney Massif hosts the highest point above sea level in the lower 48 states. This trophy status just adds to its mystique and popularity . Especially on weekends during the gentle months of summer, crowds of people ascend its hut-capped summit plateau, and even more fall along the trailside or are turned back, unprepared or simply unlucky.   To protect this busy season circus from becoming a stop and go human traffic jam, the Inyo National Forest's solution has been to create the Mount Whitney Zone. Access to this area during the peak season is controlled by strict limits on single day visitors, and even fewer overnight backpackers. Advance reservations are in much higher demand than are available, so now a lottery decides who will attempt Whitney and its near neighbors (though a small number are available for walk in visitors at the ranger station in Lone Pine).  Single day visits are free and unrestricted from Whitney Portal to Lower Boy Scout Lake, Lone Pine Lake, and via Meysan Lake to Mounts Irvine and Mallory. All crags described on the Whitney Portal page are also free to use.  Day use or overnight permits are required elsewhere in the Zone. Everything in the Lone Pine Creek drainage at slightly higher elevation than the above mentioned free sites has its access controlled.  Backpackers from further trail heads have fewer restrictions on visiting and leaving from the interior sides of Whitney, Russell and their neighbors.  Suggested reading:  Inyo National Forest's Mount Whitney Zone regulations page  The Whitney Portal Store website.  Recon: The Whitney Massif is a featured article from the 2014 American Alpine Journal with drool-inducing photos and topos.  Permits for North Fork Can be reserved here , you'll need a username and password, but it's well worth it, you can select dates ahead of time, see what's available and plan accordingly, then purchase the permits which you can pick up at the visitor's center a few miles south of Lone Pine.

description: Little Lakes Valley is another excellent high elevation starting point for day (and longer) excursions into the high Sierra. The road to the trailheads here takes one conveniently to 10,000 feet of elevation outside the snowy months, offering relatively easy access to Bear Creek Spire and neighboring alpine playgrounds. Lodges, campgrounds and trailhead parking lots offer accommodations for various levels of expense.  Mono Recesses are a series of hanging valleys west of Mono Pass, the further west you go the less visited they get. Recess Peak is located over Mono Pass, although not a climbing destination Pioneer Basin is a wonderful high and relatively remote area, one of the hallmark High Sierra scenic destinations. 
getting_there: From highway 395 at Toms Place (don't blink and miss it!), drive south into the mountains on Rock Creek Road, winding between west and south to Rock Creek Lakes Resort.  Depending on your destination, you will either turn left on Rock Creek Lake Road for Tamarack Lakes trailhead, or continue on Rock Creek Road to Mono Pass trailhead at Mosquito Flat. Two trails start here; Little Lakes Valley and Mono Pass.  Main peaks of interest are:  Bear Creek Spire - Bear Creek and Little Lakes Valley Trail Mount Dade - Little Lakes Valley Trail Mount Gabb - Little Lakes Valley Trail Mount Abbot - Little Lakes Valley Trail Mount Mills - Little Lakes Valley Trail or Mono Pass Trail Recess Peak - Mono Pass Trail  Campsites Campsites for the main peaks in Little Lakes Valley can be; the west side of Long Lake, Treasure Lakes, or Dade Lake. Some routes can be handled in a long day by fit people.  Permits Permits for this trailhead can be reserved here. Both Mono Pass and Little Lakes Valley are very popular, reserve early.  For backcountry skiers, the road is closed in winter, and parking can be had at a Rock Creek Sno-park. From there you can follow a groomed trail up to Mosquito Flats, then the wonderland of snow and mountains is your oyster. You'll need to display a permit which you can get here .

It's home to the mighty and expansive Owens Valley, the deepest in the lower 48, and one of the only known super volcanoes on the planet:  The Long Valley Caldera, just south of Mammoth.  The vistas are astounding, the weather is prime and the climbing is even better.  The Eastside offers an almost incomprehensible amount of clean, climbable rock, including sport climbing at Owens River Gorge and Clark Canyon, bouldering in the Buttermilks and Happy Boulders, and alpine climbing on 14,000' granite peaks.

The scenic 395 parallels the eastern Sierra through the Owens Valley from the L.A. basin to Reno.  Lone Pine is the first "major" town (pop. 1,655) en route, and is the jumping off point for Mt. Whitney and other popular destinations in the John Muir Wilderness (see High Sierra section).  60 miles north is the town of Bishop (pop. 3,575).  Bishop was home of the late, renowned climber/photographer Galen Rowell, who, along with his wife Barbara, was killed August 11, 2002 in a small plane crash outside town.

description: Bishop is blessed with perfect climbing conditions.   Not only is the climate perfect for climbing with only 6" average annual rainfall, and over 300 days sunshine, the crags and boulders that surround the town are world class.  The Owens River Gorge (ORG) has hundreds of top quality sport routes, and the Happy and Buttermilks bouldering venues both have world class problems.  Each of the areas have distinct characteristics, the ORG has long pumpy routes, the Happy Boulders have fun boulders that suit strong fingers and flexibility, while the Buttermilks offer fine technical challenges that reward good technique and hard callouses in one of the most scenic settings in the country.  There are many more areas than these mentioned to go climb at - just as well the weather won't let you down - 'cause you'll be busy.  In the summer months when the valley is hot there are always the higher elevations of the Mammoth and June areas no further than 1 hour away, or you can cool off with a float down the Owens River, just east of Bishop.

description: The Sierra Nevada's Palisades are loved by California mountaineers for their wild alpine character, and a jagged ridge line featuring a concentration of some of the highest summits in the state. Some of the largest remaining glaciers of the range hide in north facing cwms. This is an area where some early technical leaps forward took place in the  history of California climbing. But looking out on it firsthand, you will feel ready to make some of your own!  Surprisingly the Palisades ridge runs east to west here, allow a small series of glaciers to form below the shaded north side of the ridge. They are remnants of the Little Ice Age and how much longer they will last is open to debate. 
getting_there: Eastern Approaches For the Eastside approaches, Big Pine is the nearest town with services, and most trips start there. From highway 395 in the center of town, take West Crocker Avenue west. It soon curves and is renamed Glacier Lodge Road.  Follow it 10 miles to a large free trailhead parking area (Upper Sage Flats) on the right, there is a toilet here.   Middle Palisade and Norman Clyde Peak are accessible from Finger Lake or thereabouts, this area is reached by hiking the South Fork of Big Pine Creek Trail, although parking is at Upper Sage Flat, it's a good strategy to drive your packs down to the end of the road.  Temple Crag, Mount Sill, North Pal and its glacier are accessible from the North Fork of Big Pine Creek, which starts at the sign by the parking area toilet and crosses the brushy slope above the road up and around to the right and eventually the first falls, then onwards. A very popular trail, early reservations are recommended.  Western Approaches For the western approaches Bishop is the nearest town with services. The Bishop Pass Trail is used to access Dusy and Palisade Basins, so you'll need to drive up to the South Lake Trailhead - this is a very popular trail so early reservations are recommended. Approaches from the west are extremely long and not used for climbing in this area.  Permits These can be obtained here. Or you can wait in line the morning of the hike, something which I have only done twice in 30 years.

description: Essentially the mountains between Piute Pass and Pine Creek. Easily accessible from the east, not so much from the west. The big mountain in this region is Mount Humphreys, it's visible from many parts of the Sierra and is one of the more difficult peaks, being just shy of 14,000 feet. Humphreys Basin is a high tundra like environment, with grass and small lakes, farther north the Pine Creek basin curiously has peaks west of the main crest which are higher. Royce Lakes is a magical spot, surrounded by multiple high peaks, desolate, lifeless and yet hauntingly beautiful. Merriam Peak has recently seen multiple long rock climbs established on its north buttress.  While Mount Humphreys is obvious from Highway 395, the peaks west of Pine Creek remain aloof and mysterious, even as you hike up the Pine Creek Pass Trail, they show their shapes reluctantly. From Royce Col however, their true grandeur is revealed, and even west of those lies the highly desirable peak; Seven Gables.  When hiking up to Granite Park one cannot help but be impressed by the rocky peaks and pinnacles to the west - there are sure to be some climbs over there just waiting to be discovered. 
getting_there: From Hwy 168 west out of Bishop, the North Lake Trailhead splits off right, after passing through Aspendell. Plenty of parking usually at North Lake - although Piute Pass is also very popular in the summer months. The Piute Pass trail leads into Humphreys Basin a good camp spot for climbs on the west side of Mount Humphreys.  Pine Creek Trailhead can be reach by driving west off Hwy 395 through Rovanna and up to a rugged parking area south of the Tungsten Mill. The trailhead accesses Pine Creek Pass, Royce Lakes and through Granite Park to Italy Pass, plus it's advisable to use this trail to access the peaks west of Merriam, Royce and Feather, like Seven Gables. An old road is followed until the Pine Creek Lake Basin is reached.  White Mountain Ranger Station in Bishop is a good spot to pick up your permit, if you're coming from the south.  Permits  For the eastern approaches are available here.

Nationally renowned for high country rock climbs being developed on Incredible Hulk, which appear in most recent years' American Alpine Journals, within sight of the popular hiking and climbing destination of Matterhorn Peak. Wild mountain play of all difficulties between may be had here.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/pine-creek-canyon/105907296 
description: A beautiful granite canyon nestled between Mount Tom & the Wheeler Crest.  Most of the routes are concentrated in Sheelite Canyon, a side canyon that feeds into Pine Creek, but routes are also cropping up elsewhere, especially up canyon.  The best season is late spring until the weather craps out in the late fall.  Summer conditions are especially pleasant, as most routes are in the shade and a cool breeze often fans the canyon.    The canyon has a long history, with classics such as Pratts Crack and Sheila dating back to the 1970's.  In the early 1990's, with the boom of sport climbing in the area, Tommy Herbert added what is arguably one of the proudest 5.13a's in the country with his seldom repeated masterpiece, Ecstasy, a 100 foot laser-cut arête.  The prolific and industrious Louie Anderson almost single-handedly turned Pine Creek Canyon into a sport crag with his development of the Ministry Wall (a dense concentration of quality 5.11s) and the Planetarium Wall, with his ultra-classic, Atomic Gecko (5.12b) getting the most traffic of any hard route in the area.  It stands as a must do for the 5.12 climber.  Another standout test piece is 'Wind in the Willows Extension' (5.12d) which sports 110 feet of intense granite climbing.   Recently, there has been a resurgence of development, especially at the hands of the dynamic duo of Marty Lewis and Kevin Calder, who have almost doubled the number of sport climbs in just a couple of seasons, adding numerous new 5.11 classics to the area, including a three pitch affair.    The best source of information for the canyon can be found in Peter Croft's and Marty Lewis excellent guide, "Bishop Area Rock Climbs".

description: This page is home to all of the North American, Central American, & Carribean Island countries excluding the United States.  For information on the US, please refer to the area page for the pertinent State.  North America is a vast continent that stretches from near the Equator to beyond the Arctic Circle.  The climate & landscape is extremely varied, from baking deserts, to tropical rainforests, to ice-covered alpine mountains.  The climbing is just as varied, offering every imaginable type of climbing, from bouldering to big wall climbing; deep water soloing to high altitude mountaineering.   Destinations for Alpinists include the Canadian Rockies of Alberta & British Columbia, or the towering volcanos of Mexico.  Trad climbers will enjoy the legendary sweeping granite of Squamish, or the remote towers of the forbidding Cirque of the Unclimbables.  Sport climbers might enjoy a warm winter vacation to the towering limestone walls of El Potrero Chico or the odd basalt of Panama, or cool summer destinations like Skaha. 
getting_there: Destinations to the Great White North are often best accessed by automobile.  Driving over the border is safe & easy, but be sure you have your documents in order (see below).  For most destinations to the South, air travel is the most convenient approach.  Some destinations in northern Mexico (such as El Potrero Chico are often approached via car.

getting_there: Vancouver is easily accessed by air from anywhere and is about three or four hours drive from Seattle.  Vancouver puts you within two hours drive of vast amounts of climbing, centered on but not limited to Squamish.  Penticton, in the interior, is about a five hour drive from Vancouver and can be accessed by air either directly or by flying to nearby Kelowna.  Skaha is main destination here, but there are other quality locations in the area.  The coastal range is accessed, with difficulty from Vancouver, or by boat or plane.  Vancouver Island, which is home to some good climbing, fine mountaineering, and great trails (like the West Coast Trail) can be reached by ferry from Vancouver, or by flying to the Victoria International Airport.  The more recently developed areas on the Sunshine Coast such as the Eldred Valley are accessed by ferry from Vancouver.  There appears to be a lot of potential in this area for huge first ascents.  For the Rockies, which are closer to the border with Alberta, access for out-of-towners is often via Calgary, although the drive can be done from from Vancouver in seven to ten hours depending on your destination.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-bugaboos/105868061 
description:       The Bugaboo Provincial Park is one of the greatest alpine playgrounds in North America, and the world for that matter.  Imagine large granite spires of all shapes and sizes surrounded by beautiful glaciers and mountains as far as the eye can see and that's the Bugaboos.  All the rock is alpine granite and the quality on most routes is superb, even those which are not considered classics.  Routes range from a few hundred feet tall to a few thousand and offer anything from ridge scrambles and moderate free climbs to hard test pieces and multi-day big walls.                The climbing season is generally June to September with July and August having the best chance of good weather.  But be prepared for any kind of weather, it can storm at anytime and it snows every month of the year.  Temperatures can vary greatly depending on what side of a spire you're climbing on (North, South, East, West), if the sun's out or not, or if it's windy so plan accordingly.  An ice axe and crampons are mandatory to be safe especially later in the season when the glaciers can become a little more troublesome to negotiate due to melting.  Glacier travel skills are recommended for getting to and from most climbs unless you're staying near the campground.                There are several options for staying in the park when your visiting.  The most comfortable but also the most expensive is the Conrad Kain Hut which is managed by the Alpine Club of Canada and will cost you $25 a night (Canadian) per person as of 2013.  But provides you with a warm dry place to hang out in foul weather, a kitchen with running water and lights for late night reading.  Other more cost effective options are the campgrounds, with the Applebee campground being the most popular by far.  It will cost you $10 (Canadian) a night per person (pay at the Kain hut) and is basically a large area of somewhat flat rocks to place your tent on.  It does offer you a toilet, racks for hanging gear and food and great views which make the price seem more reasonable.   
getting_there: The Bugaboo Provincial Park is located in the Purcell range of  British Columbia, off of Highway 95.  To get to the Bugaboos travel 17 miles north of Radium Hotsprings or 48 miles south of Golden on Highway 95 depending on where your coming from to the really small town of Brisco.  Head west on a dirt road that has a sign for the park and goes past a lumber mill.  Follow the dirt road over the Columbia River and up into the mountains for 28.5 miles.  There are several turn offs along the road but there are signs at most of them for the Bugaboos otherwise just stay on the main road.    Once at the parking area there should be enough chicken wire, wood posts and rocks to protect your vehicle from rubber eating porcupines.  You'll see what I mean when you get there, don't take a chance.  The trailhead is at the west end of the parking lot and the next 3 miles to the Conrad Kain Hut are steep so pace yourself.  It's about .5 miles from the hut to the Applebee campground up more steep trail.  The new guide book "The Bugaboos" written by Chris Atkinson and Marc Piche has all the info you need for a great trip.

description: The tallest of all the Bugaboo Spires the Howser Towers boast the biggest and some of the hardest climbs in the park.  The east and northeast faces contain more alpine mountaineering routes than pure rock routes and see little action.  The west face on the other hand challenges climbers with routes up to 3000' tall and as hard as 5.12, and or A4.  These towers can be a much more serious undertaking due to their longer approach, the size of the routes, elevation, exposure and bergshrunds.    For those planning to climb a few routes on the Howsers, the East Creek Basin Bivy site is a good option.  It is located just to the southwest of South Howser Tower giving close access to the South and Central Towers.    
getting_there: There are three different approaches to the Howser Towers depending on where your trying to get to.  For the east and northeast faces approach via the Upper Vowel Glacier.  To get to the west face of the North Tower take the North Shoulder Col.  And for the west face of South and Central Towers use the East Creek approach.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/tuolumne-meadows/105833384 
description: Tuolumne Meadows is the high country climbing area of Yosemite National Park. The region is highlighted by many beautiful granite domes which offer the ultimate in knob and slab climbing. There are also classic non-dome formations like Cathedral Peak (first ascent by John Muir in the 1800's) and the Matthes Crest which are very popular with climbers. Tuolumne Meadows is a beautiful, serene place without many of the tourist popularity issues plaguing Yosemite Valley these days. The usual Tuolumne "season" for climbing runs from May through mid-Fall or so.  Some adjacent areas often grouped together with Tuolumne in guidebooks are included in the High Sierra and Lee Vining Canyon / Tioga Road areas on Mountain Project.  The main campground in the middle of the meadows is Tuolumne Meadows Campground, operated by the National Park. It's generally open from July through September. Like all campgrounds in the park and along most of Lee Vining Canyon, there's a fee to stay there. The nearest free camping is all the way across Tioga Pass, on BLM land near the town of Lee Vining where 120 crosses 395, and east of there around Mono Lake.  When Tuolumne campground is open for the summer, it also has a few climber friendly services selling gas, grub, general outdoor goods and climbing gear at somewhat higher prices than in the big city. 
getting_there: Tuolumne Meadows is accessed via highway 120, either from the west or via Tioga Pass from the east. The Tioga Pass road is generally closed (snowfall) from fall through mid to late May or so (sometimes later, depending on the snow).  The park service offers a free shuttle bus during the high season, usually from June to September. Check their website for current information.

description: The Moab area in the eastern section of Utah is amazlingly rich with bountiful opportunities for the rock climber who can appreciate the stark beauty of soft sandstone in a desert environment.  There is more than a lifetime of climbing here!  Moab is a small community, located along US 191 at the intersection with SR 128 (River Rd) south of I-70, which has become popular with the climbing and mountain biking communities of late.  Its elevation at 4025' make spring and fall make for the most pleasant times for visitors.  It is generally quite dry here; however, wandering along the River Road after a large rainfall can provide spectacular waterfall viewing.  Here, you can find climbs ranging from 1 pitch sport climbs up to 600' desert spires to multi-day adventures on the 900' The Titan to 1200' ridge/aid climbs like Everyman's Endless Edge.  Desert spires can be hauntingly beautiful like Moses, Zeus, and Aphrodite in Taylor Canyon.  Of course, there is the world-class desert crack climbing of Indian Creek.  There miles and miles of cliffs along the River Road.  You will find an wide range of subtle variations in rock type: the splitter-crack-forming Windgate, the ultra-soft Entrada, the gorgeous Navajo, the oddly solid-yet crumbly Cutler, the interesting mid-layers of Chinle, Kayenta, and more.  You must be cautious treading on desert rock for longer-than-you-think after any significant precipitation.  Most folks will find the Windgate to be most inviting here.  You climbing armamentarium will likely include beefier ropes, helmets, plenty of cams, a healthy supply of tape, and likely some anti-inflammatories for afterwards.  Most adventure climbs will require at least a double set of cams.  New climbs may require investigation of the pro & cons of desert anchors like drilled angle pins vs. expansion bolts vs. glue-in bolts.  You will likely find your gear shedding red sandstone dust for days after your visits.  New climbs in the National Parks may require particular creativity for new anchors.  Some adventure climbs will require high-clearance 4WD type vehicle to allow access.  You can climb truly roadside all the way to real adventure climbing. Weather can vary from extremes of debilitating heat to mud-trapping rain storms to frosty climes.  Pay particular attention to quick-moving lightning storms, since these are probably a climber's biggest threat here.  Be particularly careful with the delicate cryptogametic soils in the area which are key in providing soil stability and microbiotic communities in what looks like mud.  There are some areas with strict regulations, particularly in the National Parks like Canyonlands N.P. and Arches N.P.  So, check in advance.  In particular, be extremely respectful of any petroglyphs or pictographs you find.  Nonetheless, come find your personal gems here....

area_name: Arches National Park Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/arches-national-park/105716757 
description: Arches National Park is an amazing place to climb.  The area has everything - serious multipitch towers, easy one pitch towers, and hard cracks on long buttresses.  Best of all, routes in Arches are usually only a few hundred feet from the road so the approaches are casual.  Most of the routes here are on Entrada sandstone, which is much softer than the Wingate found at Indian Creek.  It often fractures vertically so there are a lot of splitters, but they are much sandier than in other parts of the desert.  On aid routes, avoid nailing whenever possible as the incredibly soft stone doesn't hold up well to abuse.  This area sees a lot of tourists, and since most of the routes are very near the road climbers must maintain as low a profile as possible.  As always in the desert, approach climbs via washes to avoid trampling cryptobiotic soil.  Some areas are closed seasonally for nesting, so check in at the visitors center before climbing.  Finally, this is a national park, so be prepared for the entrance fee.  Water is available at the visitors center.  Moab is only a few miles south, and there is lots of camping on BLM land along River Road or near Moab.  There is a national park campground in Arches, but I've never stayed there so I can't vouch for it. 
getting_there: From Moab, drive north along US 191 to the turn off for Arches National Park.  Arches is only a few miles out of town.  All climbs are accessed from this entrance - pick up a map at the visitors center.  The map has most of the formations marked on it.

description: Castle Valley is the place to go for your baptism into desert  towers.  This area is one of the birthplaces of tower climbing.  Maybe you've heard of the Kor-Ingalls Route, listed on the 50 North American Classic climbs?  Other climbs that should be done before you become too old and fat to climb are Honeymoon Chimney, Jah Man, and Fine Jade.   Overall, the rock is as good as desert sandstone (Wingate) gets, but beware of the slippery white calcite coatings found on much of the rock here.  Most routes start at honest 5.9.   
getting_there: These directions are from Moab. Basically, the turn-off for Castle Valley is about 20 miles NE of Moab off SH 128 (River Road).  Look for the sign for Castle Valley. To do anything on the Priest, Rectory, or Castleton Tower, take the Castle Valley turn-off (see here for a photo)  Go about 4.7 miles on the Castle Valley road, and then turn left on a noticeable dirt road.  Go until you can't anymore.  For Sister Superior, go about another mile up 128 (i.e., not taking the Castle Valley turn-off) and look for a dirt road (obviously on the right since the left will send you towards the Colorado River). See here for a photo of the turnout, which may also be seen from above here.   Hey, just look for stuff and figure out how to get there.  Its not like there are tons of trees blocking your view. In  both cases be prepared to walk. Look for climbers trails as much as possible to avoid trampling any cryptobiotic soil.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/tahoe-vicinity/105798291 
description: Beautiful, spacious, and often daunting, the Sierra Nevada in the Lake Tahoe area contains some of the best summer climbing in California. The area is almost entirely covered in climbable rock, and route setters will delight at the bounty of untouched potential.  Consisting mostly of granite, with a few basaltic exceptions, you will find climbs off all types, from the long traditional and sport routes at Lover's Leap, to the pumpy tall bouldering found everywhere, but most notably Donner and Pack Saddle Passes.  Climbing is year round in some places, though most areas are covered in snow from the first snow (usually in October or November) until March - June depending on altitude and direction of the rock.  Access is at most of the region's crags, especially in the public lands of the Tahoe and Eldorado National Forests. The Desolation and Granite Chief Wilderness areas have regulations you should learn about before visiting, but for day use, you can self-register for free at the major trail heads leading into them.  Also note that about a third of the Tahoe area and climbing is in Nevada, right across the unnatural straight state lines. See the Reno and Carson City area for the Tahoe vicinity's Nevada crags.  Places to stay are plentiful, from BLM camping, organized campgrounds, lodges, cheap hotels, to even four star hotels in Reno and South Lake Tahoe.  Tahoe Ice  Is a fleeting thing! And discussed on some threads inside and outside this site. Some flows form every year, others rarely so, all over the region. While no routes are documented here yet (ahem), at least one area has been created to track them: Eagle Creek Canyon Ice Climbs.  Also see Tahoe Nevada Shores and Reno and Carson City for parts of the greater Tahoe region in the state of Nevada. 
getting_there: By Road From the Bay Area, head up Highway 80 to Sacramento, where you will either head up into the hills either on 80, 50, or 89, depending on where you're going.   From Reno, head up Highway 80 to go to North Lake destinations, or down highway 395 , and then West on highway 89 into South Lake Tahoe.  Some bus services are offered by Greyhound and Amtrak.  By Air South Lake Tahoe and Truckee both have municipal airports if you have the resources.  For the rest of us, the nearest city with commercial flights is Reno. For some Tahoe areas, Sacramento's airport might be a viable second option. Each one still requires a drive into the mountains.  By Rail The first intercontinental railroad in the U.S. went over Donner Summit; one version of this line went through the Snowshed next to the climbing wall of the same name there. Amtrak still runs a train over the Sierra in this area, which runs through Truckee once a day or so. It's not cheap or fast compared to other modern travel to the Tahoe area, but is scenic (though it only goes by Donner Lake north and out of sight of Lake Tahoe).  By Trail Each year during Pacific Crest Trail season, a batch of through hikers backpack in from the south through some of the highest elevation terrain in the area, above Lake Tahoe's West Shore. Other trails connect to Reno and Sacramento.  Some climbing areas also involve travel on the historic Pony Express Trail (mostly along highway 50), or on the Tahoe Rim Trail which encircles the whole lake. Riding bikes or horses, or hiking, can be used to approach some Tahoe crags and peaks.  Over Water Around Lake Tahoe and some other area lakes, rivers or streams, deep water soloing or dry climbing spots may include travel by a variety of watercraft or swimming.  Once enough snow accumulates ever winter, many people ski and snowshoe to Tahoe's climbing areas, perhaps to do some ski mountaineering or ice climbing.

The spire is about 350 feet tall and you can walk off the uphill side without much difficulty.   Peripheral Rocks  The Sugarloaf area also includes a handful of smaller rocks that you can find along the trail leading up to Sugarloaf proper. These rocks hold a slew of low to moderate quality routes with a few classics thrown in. Routes on these rocks can range from easy 5th class to extremely difficult and vary in height between 40 and 100 feet tall.  Land Ownership  The climbing area, and the Pony Express Trail that passes below it, are both in Eldorado National Forest. You can always check the ENF Website for recent information.  But access to the Pony Express Trail and climbing areas uses public right of ways over private land. As always, please respect the locals the live and work in Silver Fork and Kyburz as you hike in and out of the public playground above.  Amenities  Local businesses, including gas stations stores, a cafe, and an inn, are just uphill and downhill from Sugarloaf on highway 50, in the towns of Silver Fork and Kyburz.  Camping There are some options for camping in the area but they are undeveloped, few and far between.  1) Drive just up the hill (east) on HWY 50 to Silverfork Rd. There are several pullouts just a few miles up the road that allow for overnight camping. However, the gate closes for the winter, so if it's snowy and icy, chances are the gate will be closed.   2) Drive down HWY 50 (West)and make a right onto 31 Milestone tract. There is a large pullout that allows camping. This road also closes in the winter months but tends to stay open longer than Silverfork Rd.   3) There is year round opportunity along Ice House Rd. Located several miles back (west) down HWY 50, Ice House Rd offers year round primitive camping along numerous pullouts and dirt roads. 
getting_there: From the Bay Area, head East on 80 to Sacramento, then take 50 East, through Placerville and another ~30 miles (if you see the town of Kyburz sign and gas station, you've gone half a mile too far). After passing School Road, look for a dirt pullout on the right shoulder, on the south side of the two lane highway, and park there. Across the road on the north side you'll see a building with a locked blue outhouse on the left. This is basically half way between School Road, and Larch Lane.    	  	              	      	  	    We had a brutal time finding the trail from the road so figured we'd document it - the trail starts to the left of this building   	   Once parked, walk to the east end of the dirt pullout, and carefully across highway 50 to get to the left side of the outhouse and fence around the building.  Walk uphill for ~200 feet and you'll find a 'now entering forest service land' sign.  From here a climber's trail is obvious and you just walk up it to the crags.  Sugarloaf is about a 30 minute hike straight up the hill. From route 50 to the base of the main formation, it's about 600 feet up over half a mile.  A more adventurous approach is to start down at 31 Milestone Tract, and find the Pony Express Trail from near the domes there. Over less than 2 miles of trail, it reaches the elevation halfway between route 50 and the base of the main Sugarloaf. This approach can be done on foot or fat tires (assuming you bring a means to secure your bike out of sight while you slog to your wall or boulder at Sugarloaf).

description: The Quail Springs Day Use Area is the first major landmark on your right if you are driving in from the West Entrance of the Park (i.e., the town of Joshua Tree).  There is a paved parking area, restroom, etc.  The main attraction here is Trashcan Rock, which hosts a high concentration of easier routes (5.0 - 5.6), a few moderates (5.7 - 5.9), and a few harder routes (5.10 - 5.11).  Several routes warrant an 'R' or 'X' rating, and as such there are usually quite a few topropes.  Not many of the climbs are all that great, but it is popular nonetheless.  In addition to Trashcan Rock, use the parking area to access Baskerville Rock, Hound Rock, and the White Cliffs of Dover.  Be sure to check out Right Baskerville Crack (5.10a) on Baskerville Rock as well as Popular Mechanics (5.9) and Ace of Spades (5.9) on White Cliffs of Dover.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/cosumnes-river-gorge/105733956 
description: Nestled into the western Sierra near the town of Placerville, you will find this granite gem. Climbing is quite varied, from short bouldering, sport, and multipitch traditional lines. Most of these are topropeable short lines, physical for their grades.  Most of the granite in the area has been washed by water over many many years, and now is quite smooth. We're not talking Yosemite glass, so friction routes are still doable.  Boasting several hundred existing routes on many different rocks, there are many many days of climbing for people of all abilities. This is an excellent place to set your first pro, and also a great place for the development of new routes.  There are no access fees for climbing in Cosumnes River Gorge. While the climbing areas are on privately owned land, the owner has permitted climbing access. A 1979 trip report by Bob Branscomb in the American Alpine Journal mentioned that the owner requests that no campfires be lit, so be a cool guest and respect this .  Descents are as varied as the climbing. 
getting_there: From Hwy 50, exit on Missouri Flats (Right). Take that a few miles until you find a T-intersection with Pleasant Valley Rd and take that to Bucks Bar. If you are unfamiliar with the area the turnout for parking is just before Buck's Bar Cir., so if you see Bucks Bar Circle road then you just passed the spot.  Once out of the car, head off the right side of the road in the middle of the guard rail.  There is a wide trail that is paved for the first few hundred feet.  The approach is downhill and takes about 10 minutes to the main climbing areas.

area_name: Fisher Towers Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/fisher-towers/105716787 
description: The Fisher Towers is one of the most difficult places in the desert to climb, but also one of the most spectacular.  The towers are huge soaring fins of mud up to 1000 feet high.  Nearly all the routes on the major towers are at least Grade IVs, and there is more than one Grade VI here.  The Fishers have a lot of history.  Shortly after making the first ascent of Castleton, Layton Kor came here to climb the largest tower, the Titan.  The extremely difficult ascent of the Finger of Fate route was the subject of a National Geographic article, and is one of the 50 Classic Climbs of North America.  After Kor climbed the Titan, Harvey Carter dominated the scene by making first ascents of every other major tower and most of the smaller ones.   The Cutler sandstone is actually very hard, but doesn't fracture into continuous crack systems like most other sandstone.  The rock is also covered with a thick layer of mud, which makes the climbing dirty, loose, difficult, and sometimes very dangerous.  The caprock for the towers is Moenkopi.  Stolen Chimney on the corkscrew summit of Ancient Art is by far the most popular route here, and at 5.9 A1 the only real moderate route.  The Colorado NE Ridge of the Kingfisher, Phantom Spirit on Echo Tower, and the Finger of Fate route on the Titan are all fairly popular and increasingly difficult.  Some of the hardest routes in the desert are here, many put up solo by Jim Beyer.  Stevie Haston has freed Echo Tower as a long scary 5.12 and nearly freed the Titan. 
getting_there: From Moab, drive north on the River Road(SH 128) past Castle Valley to the Fisher Towers turnoff sign(about 27 miles).  Drive to the parking lot at the end of the road.  All routes are accessed via the Titan Trail, which is quite good and well marked, though it can be hard to follow in the dark.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/island-in-the-sky/105716781 
description: Located in the northern sector of Canyonlands National Park, this is one of the most breath-taking places on Earth.  Island in the Sky offers adventure climbing in its purest sense on some of the most impressive towers anywhere in the desert.  Add a long and involved drive on rough roads, strenous approaches, scary rappels, and sometimes rotten, hair-raising rock and you have an area that will humble even the crustiest of desert rats.  Climbing began in this otherwordly place in the early 60's with  names like Layton Kor and Huntley Ingalls.  Other noteworthy  ascents were also made in the 60's by Larry Dalke and the Horn  brothers.  The 70's brought Fred Beckey, Eric Bjornstad, Jim Dunn, Ed Webster, Steve Hong, and many more.  The 80's saw epic free ascents by Charlie Fowler, Chip Chace, Ken Sims, Webster,  Dreiman, Olevsky and others.  Standards of difficult and dangerous free climbing continue to be pushed in the area and many new lines await those with the ability and courage to try them.  The best times to go to Island in the Sky are Spring and Fall.  Beware of snow and ice on the road in the Spring - it's a big drop in places!  It is cold in the winter and very hot in the Summer, duh.  Plan on early starts for everything here and don't underestimate any route. The drive out is long and can be  difficult to follow in the dark.  Climbing in the Island is dangerous, so if you can not accept this fact do not go there.  Loose rock abounds and every route will have some suspect stone on it.  Wear a helmet if you enjoy the use of your brain.  Plan on replacing worn webbing on rappels, don't skimp, it's your ass out there.  Moab is the closest hospital.  This is a fragile environment and is a national park for  everyone's enjoyment, so please leave no trace.  Look for existing trails and stay in rocky washes whenever possible. National park rules apply here, so don't bring your dog and don't leave any new fixed gear unless it is an emergency.  Clean aid only, no hammers!!!   
getting_there: Arrive at Island in the Sky via the White Rim Jeep Trail (do not try this in a low-clearance car).  Head northwest out of Moab on  191, and turn left onto 313 after 9 miles.  Drive 22 miles to the junction with the Shafer Trail and the ranger station.  Follow the Shafer trail and descend for 4 miles to the White Rim trail.  Continue for another 13 miles passing the Airport Towers to Buck Canyon and Monster Tower.  Continue on for another 18 miles to reach Monument Basin.  Allow at least 3 hours to reach Monument Basin from the ranger station.  Buy a map but beware that Monster Tower, Washer Woman, and Sandcastle are incorrectly located on the map.  A guide book is a good idea.

description: An excellent mix of trad and sport lines, often with routes very close together (some contrived sport routes do exist, but this is not the norm) and the ability to belay from your car or with only a very short walk in make the Potash Road crags a must-climb for any visitor.  They are also an excellent introduction to some of the more committing desert climbs in the region.  You won't find some of the tower climbing, the mudpiles, or the splitter cracks of other areas, but instead flakes, slabs, nubbins, edges, and other features abound.  Well over a hundred routes exist in the Wall Street area alone, and dozens of others on the other roadside crags and in side canyons.  Routes range from 5.4 TR slabs to at least 5.12+, with most being in the .10-.11 range but also with many moderate classics (.8-.9s).    Please use the restroom facilities at either the Jaycee Campground (3.9 miles in) or at the "Indian Writing" sign (5 miles in).  Use caution with the anchors and rock, and rap when necessary to preserve the rock and anchors; and watch for poison ivy in the summer!  Watch for speeding potash-haulers and 4x4s, as well as tourons watching you and not the road, and be sure to park out of the way.  
getting_there: Potash Road (Utah highway 279) is less than five minutes from downtown Moab, and the approach to many of the routes is zero.  From Moab drive North on 191 (the main drag) for 1.3 miles past the bridge over the Colorado River (or 1 mile South from Arches NP) and turn South on 191, marked with signs for Potash and 279.  All distances to crags are measured from this intersection.

The Ice Cream Parlor is entirely a trad area (as far as I know) on good rock on Navajo and Wingate formations, with lots of possibilities for future hard free and aid route development.  Routes on various crags range from 5.8 slabs/cracks to 5.12- and C2 grade IV climbs.  Primitive camping areas are located along the roadside near some of the crags, and there is a potable natural spring 2.2 miles into the dirt road.  BASE jumpers frequent the Tombstones and are fun to watch, or you can do one of the long trad or free routes on them. 
getting_there: From Main Street Moab (US 191), head west on Kane Creek Blvd from the McDonald's on the south end of town, or intersect Kane Creek Blvd from 400 North.  Head north as you leave town, under the east-facing cliffs above town, and past the scenic chairlift.  The road continues north and then turns south as it passes the Portal and parallels the river for three miles (paved), opposite Wall Street.  Mark distances for rocks from the cattleguard about 3 miles along the south portion of the road, where pavement ends.  A high-clearance 2WD will make the road with no problems.  Expect switchbacks, graded speedbumps (difficult for low-slung vehicles), and big rocks in the roadway.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/05---convict-lake--mcgee-creek/110847763 
description: This area encompasses the trail heads at Convict Lake and McGee Creek. The high peaks are easily visible from 395 on your way to Mammoth Lakes, Mount Morrison in particular is very impressive, especially in winter when it's covered in snow.  West of Mount Morrison the peaks, except for Red Slate Mountain, lay back a bit on the main crest, with Morrison, Laurel and Bloody Mountain therefore gaining dominance. The rock east of the main crest is not granite, but sedimentary in nature.  The McGee Creek trail follows a flat valley southwards for quite a distance before kicking in and heading steeply up to the Big McGee Basin. The trial eventually heads over McGee Pass and down into Fish Creek, which is quite a hike. To the west of Big McGee Lake lies Red and White Mountain - a very worthy and daunting peak.  There are some easy peaks on the west to east ridge south of Big McGee Lake which have some very nice views down into Pioneer Basin and across to the Abbot Group.  The Convict Lake Trail heads west then south down a spectacular and slightly creepy canyon guarded by sentinels on both sides before reaching the lakes north of Red Slate Mountain. 
getting_there: McGee Creek Trailhead McGee Creek Trailhead is at the end of the McGee Creek Road past Crowley Lake, turn west off 395. There is a paved parking lot at the trailhead.  McGee Pass This is a long hike, and quite flat at the start, following the canyon south towards the beckoning high tree-filled bowl and peaks behind it. After a second creek crossing (the first one can be a challenge) there's a long uphill section which will get your attention until it levels off and from there you cross meadow like terrain and up benches to Big McGee Lake (2600 feet elevation gain from the trailhead), take along rest here, the next section is grueling. The trail heads northwest past Little McGee Lake, for another 1500 feet of elevation gain, up switchbacks and red and black cobbles to the pass, where you realize, in the descending sun, it's along way yet to a nice camp site.  Convict Lake Trailhead Turn west off 395 onto the Convict Lake Road. Convict Lake Trailhead is located at the end of a spur road which cuts off right just before the Convict Lake Resort - there is a lonely paved parking area here too.  Permits Are available here.

area_name: 08 - Bishop Pass and Evolution Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/08---bishop-pass-and-evolution/110819748 
description: Peaks north of Bishop Pass, and south of Piute Pass form two basic groups, Bishop Group and Evolution Group. While there are no 14,000 ft peaks in these groups the peak are high and majestic.  The Bishop Group is accessible from the South Lake Trailhead, either to Treasure Lakes, or Bishop Pass. There are many popular campsites along both of these trails. Cross country travel is possible from the Treasure Lakes Trail to the Bishop Pass Trail. Both trails are short and easy. As stated this is a very popular area.  The Evolution Group is accessible from the trailhead at Lake Sabrina, which splits at Blue Lake to take you to either Mount Thompson (left) or (right) Mount Darwin, etc. The trails are a little longer but still reasonably moderate. The right branch also splits heading (left) either to Hungry Packer Lake for Picture Perfect Peak, Mount Haeckel, or over Alpine Col. or (right) to Mount Darwin and Blue Heaven Lake.  The north faces of Mounts Darwin and Mendel are accessible via Lamarck Col, which follows the Lamarck Lake Trail from North Lake, the heads south and west from there over the main crest - an excellent way into Darwin Canyon.  The west side of the Evolution Group can also be reached from Florence Lake, via a ferry and an extremely scenic hike south through Evolution Valley, this is a long approach. 
getting_there: South Lake and Lake Sabrina Both South Lake and Lake Sabrina are accessible from Hwy 168, which heads west out of Bishop. There's a ranger station (White Mountain) in Bishop which is a good location to pick up your permit the night before. The South Lake Road splits off left before the small community of Aspendell. Parking at both of these trailheads is tight, especially South Lake as Bishop Pass is very popular.  The South Lake trailhead serves two destinations, one to Bishop Pass and the other splits off right after about a mile and takes you to Treasure Lakes - which has to have the highest ratio in the Sierra for short hike/beautiful spot.  North Lake The North Lake Trailhead splits off right, after passing through Aspendell. Plenty of parking usually at North Lake - although Piute Pass is also very popular in the summer months. Mentioned here because it is the trailhead for Lamarck Col.  Permits  For the eastern approaches are available here.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/04---ritter-and-the-minarets/110847705 
description: A distinct metamorphic sub-range within the granite ocean of the High Sierra, the Ritter Range has a completely different feel to the majority of the other areas, mainly due to its different and older rock, it's a very scenic and famous area, with the JMT running on its eastern margin. There are two sub-areas, to the south there are the fantastic Minarets, Clyde and Michael being the stand outs, they have no easy routes to their spectacular summits. To the north lies Mount Ritter and Banner Peak, Ritter is a very big mountain, don't underestimate it, and while Banner has a walk up route there are some more technical climbs on its east face.  There used to be some impressive small glaciers in this area, with real crevasses which lent the area a feel of mountains further north, who knows how they'll fare with the climate change.  Both The Minarets and Ritter/Banner are mostly accessed from the east, via the Minaret Road from Mammoth Lakes. The trailhead for The Minarets is at Red's Meadow and for Ritter and Banner; Agnew Meadows.  Iceberg Lake and Lake Ediza are the main camping areas for the Minarets, and Ritter and Banner respectively. 
getting_there: Eastern Approaches From Hwy 395 turn west to Mammoth Lakes and follow signs for Hwy 203 to Minaret Summit, you'll drive past the Mammoth Mountain Ski resort on the way there. Be aware that during summer you'll have to take a shuttle if you don't drive to either of the trailheads "after hours". I usually plan to park at the trailheads in the evening to avoid riding the shuttle.  From Minaret Summit the Minaret Road heads north down the slope, Agnew Meadows trailhead is a turnoff just before the road does a hairpin and heads south the Red's Meadow.  For lightweight backcountry skiers; the Minaret Road if often groomed to Red's Meadow and makes for a wonderful easy run down to Agnew Meadows, with a straightforward skin back out.  Permits Permits for both trailheads can be reserved here.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/10---kearsarge-pass-to-cedar-grove/110847783 
description: This area encompasses the big lake basins north of these two trailheads; Rae Lakes, Sixty Lakes and Gardiner, the scenic approach to Golden Trout Lakes and Dragon Pass, plus the immaculate dome west of Charlotte Lake which can also be accessed from both trailheads and the fabulous 2000 foot wall on the north side of Bubb's Creek Canyon. Rae Lakes and Sixty Lakes are famous for their beauty, and the former is a very popular spot on the famous back packing loop starting at Cedar Grove. Charlotte Lake is also a very popular camping spot, and there's a backcountry ranger hut here.  While Rae Lakes are very popular Sixty Lakes can be empty, perhaps because it's harder to get to, but it's well worth the trip, it's very remote and beautiful with Mount Cotter and Mount Clarence King being spectacular peaks. Further west lies the even more remote Gardiner Basin.  This whole area is infamous for bear activity. 
getting_there: Western Trailheads Cedar Grove - take Hwy 180 through Grant Grove Village to Road's End - a long and scenic drive, if it isn't dark. From here you can access Road's End and Bubb's Creek which will take you to Charlotte Creek and then cross-country north to camp spots beneath Charlotte Dome - you can also continue farther east to hook up with the faded Gardiner Basin Trail. Sphinx Lakes and Avalanche Pass is accessible by a trail at the top of the switchbacks heading up to Bubb's Creek. Continuing along the Bubb's Creek Trail past Charlotte Creek will get you to the Bubb's Creek Wall.  Eastern Trailheads Kearsarge Pass: Take the Onion Valley Road west from Independence to the large parking loop at the trailhead (there's camp sites here too). Kearsarge Pass allows quick easy access over the main crest, for Charlotte Dome head down and past Charlotte Lake, do the same for Rae Lakes and Sixty Lake Basin, but stop and camp at the lake because the next day you'll be heading over Glen Pass, then either down to Rae Lakes or over Sixty Lake Col to Gardiner or Clarence King.  Either way and whatever your destination these are long and arduous hikes, especially toting climbing equipment.  Golden Trout Lakes/Dragon Pass: From the Onion Valley Parking Loop there's a trail which runs north, up into the Golden Trout Lakes, and Dragon Peak basins, from the loop there's a big waterfall, the trail heads up old scree and passes this on the right, then crosses it's top and follows a depression until a meadow is reached, Golden Trout Lakes is to the left and Dragon Pass is to the right. This meadow is very scenic, with large towers to the north, there is camping at the two lakes beneath Dragon Peak. For Dragon Pass head for the low point to the right of the large square tower right of Dragon Peak, the pass itself is a high plateau to the right of this, followed by a long scree descent to Dragon Lake and thence Rae Lakes - don't attempt the obvious low point between Dragon Peak and the square tower. This offers a one-day route to Rae Lakes, but it's not easy.  The trail also give access to Sardine Canyon via the 12,000 foot pass west of Kearsarge Peak, which is a ski mountaineering objective and one of the coolest ski descents in California.  Permits: For the western approaches are available here.  For the eastern approaches are available here.

area_name: Lover's Leap Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/lovers-leap/105733959 
description: This area is an excellent 250 to nearly 600 foot tall chunk of mostly vertical granite, containing hundreds of cracks crisscrossed with thousands of horizontal dikes. These dikes are key to reducing what would otherwise be very steep and difficult traditional routes, into routes with good rests and abundant holds, resulting in an area with relatively moderate grades. You will find over 250 developed routes that range from low bouldering traverses to 4 pitches tall. Some routes are bolt protected, but most of the sport climbing is 5.10+ YDS or harder, as the abundance of traditionally protected routes in close proximity to each other discourages squeezing in a bunch of moderate sport face climbing. All of the routes demand less than 20 minutes to "hike" into, as the entrance path is part of the pioneer trail, and therefore excellently maintained and quite wide.   Lovers Leap can sometimes seem crowded in certain areas, especially in the summer on weekends. However there is an almost limitless number of adventure routes and hidden classics that rarely ever see any traffic. As long as you're willing to step outside the box and try something that is not a "trade route", you will never have to wait in line or climb anywhere near other climbers... ever! Lovers Leap has a higher concentration and number of routes in close proximity to each other than any other crag in California. Add to that it's wide range of difficulty in routes and there is more than enough to keep everyone busy for a long time.   The main formation is traditionally divided into these walls, from right/west/closest to the campground, to left/east/furthest:West Wall, Main Wall, Central Wall, and East Wall. The second largest formation is the Hogsback. Many other small developed walls abound, mostly not yet covered on this site (seven or more of these are covered in Carville's Tahoe climbing guide). The nearest and most popular of these are the Lower Buttress and Dear John Buttress. The Loaf Boulder and Monks Rock are major boulders right outside the campground; other potential abounds in less convenient and obvious pieces of granite.  Camping and Amenities  There is a developed campground (first come, first served) at the western foot of the cliff. To find the campground, pull into the Strawberry Lodge parking lot. Follow the road to the left of the lodge past several cabins until you cross a small bridge over the river. After the bridge take an immediate left up a single lane road. Follow this road until it ends at the campground.   Camping is $10 (U.S.) a night and $5 (U.S.) for an extra car per day. There is limited day parking ($5) in the campground for climbers. Overflow parking is found along the road 100 yards past the bridge/river on the right side of the road. Do not park alongside the road leading to the campground or in the Strawberry Lodge parking lot. Your car may be towed at your expense, (up to $1000 dollars in fines and/or a 30 day impound can be applied).     Conveniently located at the edge of the campground are a few large boulders worth doing. From the parking lot, head uphill and cross over the small foot bridge to the Pony Express Trail. Hang a left, and walk up the gently sloped trail for about 3 minutes.   Almost all multipitch routes are best to walk off, both for the preservation of existing vegetation, and that most routes don't have any fixed protection at the top of the rock due to the abundance of trees, cracks, and large rocks at the top.  You can get pretty good food at the Strawberry Lodge, breakfast, lunch and dinner. They serve food at the bar as well and is a bit cheaper too. The Lodge is very climber friendly and showers can be purchased for a small fee. Just ask at the front desk.   Across the street is the Strawberry Station, where you can pick up drinks and basic goods. There is also a small but usually well stocked gear store which carries all your basic (and then some) climbing gear. They also rent shoes and probably other gear if you just happen to forget something. It is owned and operated by a great and friendly local family the head of which is Squirrel, a local climber with all the beta you'll ever need. Be sure to stop in and support their friendly business.  Access  CRAGS, the local Access Fund affiliate, hosts yearly Adopt-a-Crag events, and collaborates with the Eldorado National Forest. 
getting_there: From the Bay Area / Sacramento: Head East on highway 50 towards Placerville.  Continue past Placerville to the town of Strawberry, which is approximately 8 miles past the more marked Kyburz. Turn off the freeway onto the small route that parallels the 50 just on the far side of the Strawberry lodge, which is hard to miss on your right. This is about 40 miles past Placerville.  You get a good glimpse of the west and main walls as you get close to the Lodge on a clear day.  From Lake Tahoe: Head 18 miles West on Highway 50 to the town of Strawberry, where you should head a left just before the Strawberry Lodge, which will approach on your left after a magnificent view of Lover's Leap looming to the left on the way to the lodge.  From the Strawberry Lodge: Follow the road that Parallels the 50.  At the junction, head left, and travel through the small neighborhood quietly and slowly, as advised by local signs.  You will run directly into the parking lot about 1/3 mile later.  The trailhead is towards the rear of the lot.

description: LCC offers primarily quartz monzonite (white granite, essentially) with a few areas of limestone.  Trad, sport, bouldering, and ice climbing are all well-represented here. Most of the climbs are on the sunnier, north side of the canyon, but shade may be found for those hot summer days. In addition, north-facing classic routes are found on the south side of the canyon (see especially Pentapitch Area and Coal Pit Buttress.  On the north side of the canyon, roughly from The Egg past the Gate Buttress, the rock is either owned by or the approaches to the tock cross land owned by the LDS Church. Be considerate when crossing/using these areas.  The Wasatch Resort about one mile up the canyon on the right (south) presents access problems to some of the crags on that side of the canyon as well.  
getting_there: From the I-215 beltway around Salt Lake, take the 6200 South exit at the southeast corner of the loop.  Follow signs to the ski resorts and Big and Little Cottonwood canyon.

area_name: The Bastille Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-bastille/105807521 
description: The Bastille is a cornerstone of climbing in Eldorado Canyon State Park.  According to P. Ament in High Over Boulder this was once called Chimney Rock and may have been named The Bastille by Stan Shepard in 1957.  This modest, 350 foot crag can be divided into The N face and the W face for organizational purpose.  The N face is steep, shaded, and has exceptional routes for intermediate climbers and advanced climbers who seek out the mental challenges in addition to the physical.  There are those who counts the seconds attempting to set solo speed records here.  There is probably little for the lower end difficulty climber nor the high end climber here.  The W face provides a wonderful afternoon exposure for the cooler months.  Topping out provides a wonderous view of this spirit-elevating canyon.  Once, the summit provided an anchor point for the cable upon which crossed Ivy Baldwin on many death-defying crossings of the canyon.  Today, the cable remains testament to a disappearing breed of adventurer.  Climbing here began at least in the 1950s.  There are legends of Frenchmen swilling champagne during an ascent up this rock on French Independence Day.  The legendary, Jim Erickson, elevated himself to the challenge of an onsight, solo, first ascent of Blind Faith on the W face.  Today, this remains a crag that holds a special place in the hearts of climbers who have progressed to climb some of the great walls and peaks of the world.  Our climbing history shows the first recorded ascent within the canyon when two Army climbers ascended the Bastille Crack in 1954 according to P. Ament in High Over Boulder & R. Rossiter in Boulder Climbs South.  This crag has been a proving grounds for some of Colorado's finest including: Layton Kor, Steve Komito, Ray Northcutt, Pat Ament, Larry Dalke, Dave Rearick, Bob Culp, Stan Shepard, Roger Briggs, Jim Erickson, Art Higbee, Duncan Ferguson, Dudley Chelton, Jeff Lowe, Kevin Donald, Rob Candelaria, David Breashears, Ed Webster, Christian Griffith, Colin Lantz, Derek Hersey, Mic Fairchild, Steve Levin, Chris Archer, among others.  Some of the finest routes here include: The Bastille Crack, 5.7; Hair City, 5.9 s; Werksupp, 5.9+; West Buttress, 5.9++; Blind Faith, 5.10a; Outer Space, 5.10c;  Northcutt Start, 5.10d (likely Colorado's first 5.10 in 1959 by the gifted Ray Northcutt); X-M, 5.10d s; Rain, 5.10d s; Northwest Corner, 5.11a s; Wide Country, 5.11a s; Sunset Boulevard, 5.11b/c; The Spice Tour, 5.11 s; Hairstyles and Attitudes, 5.12c/d; Your Mother, 5.12d.  There are so many variations, linkups that it may be hard to list them all and unmotivating for most to submit these to the database.  Note, there is still significant amounts of loose rock on this crag and pedestrians & cars lie below.  Also, there is much aging fixed hardware here.  Descents off the top traverse along a break/ramp near the top to the N side of the rock and gain a 3rd class ramp down to the Fowler Trail.  From here, descend the West Face hiking trail (3rd class near the bottom) back down to the base.  A few of the routes have rappel descents, but they are the minority.  Come and climb here, but realize that many share your passion for the experiences found on this stone. 
getting_there: Once you enter Eldorado Canyon State Park, you will hopefully find parking within 200 yards in one of two areas.  Park.  Walk uphill to the obvious bridge across South Boulder Creek.  Look up and left.  This is The Bastille.  The N face is accessed off the road.  The W face is accessed off a 3rd class trail just around the corner and up the steep slope.

area_name: Devil's Tower Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/devils-tower/105714267 
description: Devil's Tower crams a high concentration of great cracks into the smallest area possible.  People come from around the world to climb on this unique wonder.  Climbing is sustained, and cracks are beautiful and uniformly shaped.  Essentially, there is a crack every 5 or 10 feet, and they mostly run perfectly up and down, which reduces rope drag.  The majority of the tower is less than vertical, and faces are blank.  There are few face climbs, but who needs them with all these splitter cracks?  The easiest route to the summit is Durrance, which is stout 5.6.  In general, climbs that are 5.8 and under tend to be offwidths, 5.9 are hand cracks, and 5.10 are finger cracks.  There is too many classics to list.  However, check out Assembly Line, Walt Bailey, and Soler for 5.9.  For 5.10, go to One-Way Sunset, Hollywood & Vine, and Tulgey Wood.    Many routes are best done by climbing the first few pitches and then rappeling.  Fixed anchors are numerous.  The rock quality is poor for the last 100 feet of the tower or so.  Most parties who summit do so through the Meadows area.  This is the ledgy area that is a small distance below the summit on South face of the tower.  Climbs such as Durrance, Wiessner, Bon Homme, Walt Bailey, and Soler use this.  From the meadows, follow a 4th class chimney and ramp system to the summit (some parties rope up).  To descend from the summit, a rap anchor is on the south side.  two ropes are required.  The summit part can either be rappeled or downclimbed to the meadows (easy, but exposed).  Then, 3 two rope rappels are required to get down to the ground.  Be careful when rappeling from the meadows -- it is very easy to get your rope hopelessly stuck in the cracks, so rap over the face. 
getting_there: Drive to Sundance, Wyoming, and then take highway 24 north from I-90.  Just follow the signs, and drive towards the big chunk or stone.  Turn into the monument and pay the entrance fee.  Then continue to the visitor's center.  From here, make sure to register for the climb (this is free - used for record keeping and rescues, etc.).  Then, approaches differ by route from here.

description: Welcome to Hidden Valley Campground - the Camp 4 of Southern California.  HVCG has a high concentration of quality routes and one could potentially spend a week in The Park without ever leaving the campground. As such, the area sees more than it's fair share of traffic. A few considerations and logistics while you're here:      Entrance fee (currently $20) is valid for 7 days of purchase. Camping in the Park is $10/campsite/night, and is on a first-come, first-served basis (no reservations).  However, reservations may be made online for group campsites at Indian Cove, Sheep Pass, Cottonwood, and Black Rock Campgrounds through the NPS Reservation Center.  More about camping....     Weekends are crowded during peak season! With its proximity to Los Angeles and San Diego, the Park draws more than 1 million visitors annually. Plan accordingly and have a backup plan if the campgrounds are full.  There are numerous inexpensive motels in the nearby towns of Joshua Tree, Yucca Valley, and 29 Palms.    There are no gas stations in the Park itself. There are two gas stations in the town of Joshua Tree - a Valero on the corner of Park and Hwy 62 and at a Circle K (no diesel) which is a block to the east. Yucca Valley, 6 miles west of town on Hwy 62, has many gas stations to choose from with most having lower prices than the ones in Joshua Tree.      There is no running water in the Park. Come prepared with a 5-gallon or more jug if planning on staying more than a day. The last place to fill up is at the West Entrance kiosk, where you'll pay 25 cents for 5 gallons.       Protect your food!!! Coyotes, squirrels, and scrub jays WILL raid your food if left out. A couple of durable plastic storage bins will make your life a lot easier and will help to keep the critters self-sufficient.      Cell phones reception is spotty, but good reception can be had at Key's View. There is an ***EMERGENCY ONLY*** phone located at the second bathroom in main loop of Hidden Valley Campground. The closest payphone is at Coyote Corner at the SE corner of Park Blvd and Hwy 62.      	  	              	      	  	    Olden days! Photo used with permission from T. Yeary

getting_there: Drive 1.25 miles up Little Cottonwood Canyon parking at either the lot on the left or along side the right side of the road.  There is a main trail that begins on the west side of the parking lot that leads up to the Gate Boulders where the trail forks. For the Dihedrals and Beckey's Wall take the right fork and head up hill. This branch is rather fragmented and is not always clear. For all other crags continue west as the trail meanders through the revegetated talus area. See the individual crag descriptions for more info on getting to them.  Note: In 1998 through 2000 the area below where the approach trail is located was quarried and is presently under revegetation. Please stay on the climber's trail so it can recover.

Depending on the snow fall of the previous winter climbing begins generally in late April and May, and continues through until November (depending on Snow fall).   Some of the bouldering areas closer to the 395 are open all year around.  Crystal Crag is a fine example of the granite crags, while Clark Canyon is the best of the tuff sport crags.

There are a couple of climbs that go all the way to the summit.   However, some of the best climbing is found along the North East base of the peak.  The rock along the base is good quality granite, with many dikes and knobs.  The cliffs get early morning sun, and are blissfully sheltered from the strong summer sun, for most of the day. 
getting_there: Park at the Lake George parking lot and start hiking on the Crystal Lake Trail. After about 20 mins a sign to Crystal Lake is seen.   Hang a left at the sign and follow the trail down to the lake.  Follow the trail around the lake and after about 100 yards, take the climbers trail on the left.   Follow this until you reach the base of the cliff.    The approach takes about 45 minutes.

description: Located between major urban centers Los Angeles to the south and the San Francisco Bay to the north, the quaint Central Coast of California spans a 300-mile stretch from the southern Santa Monica Mountains to the northern Monterey Peninsula.  While known primarily for surfing, celebrities, exorbitant real estate prices, and wine-tasting (the movie "Sideways" was filmed locally), there is actually surprisingly good climbing to be found.  The majority of rock around Santa Barbara, Ventura, and Ojai is medium-grade sandstone (i.e., a little friable), but there's also blue schist (Green Dome), andesite (SLO), and conglomerate (Silly Rock, Wheeler Gorge) out there.  The climbing is by no means world class, but what it lacks in quality it makes up for in aesthetics.  As a friend of mine would say, "maybe not 4-star climbing, but makes for a 4-star day!"  Areas like the Sespe Gorge (Black Wall) had established routes as early as the late 50s and 60s.  Over the years, many well-known climbers have graced these small cliffsides, including the likes of Yvon Chouinard (Yosemite legend and founder/owner of Patagonia), Jonny Woodward (Black Diamond), Jim Donini and even Henry Barber!  Around Santa Barbara and Ventura, pioneers of the '80s and '90s included Kevin Brown, Kevin Steele, Steve Tucker, Menzo Baird, Bob Banks (author of "Ocean's Eleven") and Steve Edwards (guidebook author of "Rock Climbing Santa Barbara & Ventura"), who established many of the newer sport routes around Santa Barbara and Hwy 166/Silly Rock.    In San Luis Obispo county, pioneers include Rusty Garing, Dwight Kroll, Pete Gulyash, brothers Tim and Tobin Sorenson, Ed Sampson, Ken Klis, Tom Slater (guidebook author of "California Central Coast Climbs"), and Brandon Thau. Slater, Thau, and Klis are responsible for developing such crags as Cerro Romauldo, Cabrillo Peak and Big Rocks.  Former Access Fund director Reese Martin lived in the area for a time.  Sadly, he was killed in a paragliding accident in July 2004 at the age of 49 (More...). 
getting_there: Hwy 101 is the major artery between Ventura and San Luis Obispo (and beyond).  99% of the routes described here lie either off the 101, 154 (San Marcos Pass), 33 (Ojai), or 166 (east of Santa Maria).

area_name: Pinnacles National Park Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/pinnacles-national-park/105733947 
description: Pinnacles National Park is a Bay Area Climber's nightmare or savior, depending one's interest. Its close proximity to the South Bay and moderate weather during the Winter months make it very popular with the Bay Area climbing community, but at the same time the area is known for its "less than granite quality" rock. Some despise its chossy character, others revel in its history of adventure and "ground up" ethic.  As a former haunt of some of Yosemite's children of the Golden Age of climbing, the names of Roper, Bridwell, Bates are associated with this area. It has bolt-protected face climbs due to the lack of good cracks, as well as more traditional climbs.   An Intro to the Pinnacles by Steven Dalleske  Tap tap tap, tap tap tap, I can always tell when an experienced Pinnacles climber is in the area. The fact is you can usually hear them long before you see them. Tapping the holds with our knuckles is just one of the unique techniques we have learned to rely on over the years of scrambling across this unique rock. For me, the farther I am from my last protection the more I'm tapping and if I'm really wigging out you'll see me start kicking at the foot holds too. What I'm doing is listening for a nice sharp report from the knob or cobble in question. Something that will let me know how well it's attached to the cliff and how much I want to rely on it. A dull or hollow sound above a fall you're not interested in taking and you should be looking for alternatives. If there are no viable alternatives, its time to decide how bad you want the route and if you decide to push on you'll, at the least, have a better understanding what your getting into. Keep in mind, though, that if you seriously tried to avoid all the loose rock at the Pinns, you're route selection would be seriously limited if not non-existent. Climbing the Pinnacles rock is an art, it's something that takes an acquired taste to really appreciate, but once mastered it's an art that will give you new confidence when visiting other more sound climbing areas.   Another good habit to adopt when negotiating the minefields that are the Pinnacles rock is to try to avoid stepping on the knobs. This is because, when a weighted knob pops, under your foot you'll be at the end of your rope or bouncing off a ledge before you know it. Consequently, a seasoned Pinn-head will, given the opportunity, consciously avoid using the knobs for footholds and instead seek features in the matrix to find a purchase for the foot. The matrix being like a gritty mortar that holds the cobbles in place tends to crumble rather than pop as the knobs do and this can, in some cases, give you the extra second needed to make a decision and hopefully an escape. Eventually you'll find yourself spreading your weight out on the rock, moving like a cat, taking full advantage of stances, exploring and carefully planning your sequences, appreciating a sound bolt more than ever before, clipping anchors with a relief that overwhelms and if you can learn love this careful style of climbing, you've become a true Pinn-head.   Because of the unique rock here, soloing and bouldering at the Pinns, though not unheard of, is considered foolhardy, if not suicidal. Ironically, most of the moderate routes here have serious run outs on them which, coupled with our not so lovable rock makes even the easiest route a serious endeavor. You must always be conscious of your potential falls, this is not a place to haphazardly romp around 20' out from the last bolt. Since the knobs pop on all routes equally, you are more likely to get hurt on something easy like the Portent, 5.6 with it's 20' to 30' run outs than something a little harder like Cantaloupe Death, 5.10c which has mere 6' to 8' run outs. In most cases the easier routes were put up 30, 40 or even 50 years ago in a bygone time when climbing was a more dangerous animal, commitment was at a premium and protection was sub standard by modern ideals. Consequently if you are not already familiar with the rock here, I don't consider the Pinnacles a great place to teach yourself leading. Over the last decade the bolts on most of the more popular routes have been brought up to modern standards, but the run outs, long and true, are and always will remain. 
getting_there: Depending on whether one is going to the more popular East District or the West District will dictate how to get there.   For the East District, go South on 101 to Hwy 25 to Hollister. Go South out of Hollister for several miles until you reach the turn off for Pinnacles National Park.  Go past the campground and entrance station (fee) and continue to where you can go left over the bridge instead of to the Chalone Picnic area. Park at the end of the road, unless the small lot is full. On occasion if you arrive late you may need to take the shuttle in from the lower parking lot.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/new-york/105800424 
description: Rock Climbing in New York State consists of three main regions: the world-famous Gunks, properly called the Shawangunks; the Adirondacks, a vast state park with dozens of crags scattered across an area the size of Rhode Island; and Moss Island, a small crag near Little Falls.  Several other areas exist, e.g. bouldering in Central Park, the Timp in Harriman Park, as well as many places of questionable access and/or worth.  The main rock climbing venues are near the eastern side of the state, so folks out in Rochester, Buffalo, etc. have a tough time of it - they're either traveling a long ways, pumping plastic, sneaking into the Niagara gorge, or driving across the border to climb in Canada.  Ice climbing is a bit more evenly spread out. The Adirondacks holds the most reliable and extensive ice, but the Catskills generally forms a lot of good ice as well, and the Finger Lakes Region boasts a few lesser-known classic lines (many of which, alas, are not legal to ascend).  Alpine climbing is limited to the Adirondacks, though a few Catskill peaks come close. None of the mountains are particularly tall - Mt. Marcy, at 5,344' is the highest - but the weather is capricious and runs the extremes. Winter ascents of the High Peaks can be very serious endeavors, especially when climbing a classic line such as the Trap Dike or Gothics North Face.  Although a small state compared to the big West, travel in NY, especially to its mountainous regions, can be tricky. Public transport is decent within two hours of NYC along the major transport corridors, but off these or farther away, and car rental, good maps, and good luck are required.  The great majority of visitors arrive in New York City; for those who do, the Gunks is a 2 hour bus ride to reach, and is definitely the place to go for rock climbing. The Catskills is a bit farther north, and having a car is almost mandatory, particularly during ice season. The Adirondacks is 4 to 5 hours away, and also requires a car. Moss Island lies along Interstate 90 and busses stop in the neighboring town of Little Falls

area_name: The Gunks Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-gunks/105798167 
description: The Gunks (short for Shawangunks) is one of the premier climbing areas in the country.  Located near New Paltz, NY, the Gunks is about 85 miles from the NYC metropolitan area, making it a popular weekend destination.  The rock is quartz conglomerate, solid rock with horizontal rather than vertical cracks. Climbing at the Gunks is characterized by roofs, jugs, traverses, big air, and sometimes "sporty" pro.  The Gunks is famous for great one-to-three-pitch climbs of all levels of difficulty.  You'll find some of the best easy and moderate trad climbs in the country at the Gunks.  There are a few bolted climbs at the Gunks, but no sport climbs.    The ratings at the Gunks are stiff; beware of a climb with a "+" at the end of its rating.  Climbs like Thin Slabs / Thin Slabs Direct (5.7+), Something Interesting (5.7+), Modern Times (5.8+), Broken Sling (5.8+), Le Teton (5.9+), and Coexistence (5.10+) will seem like sandbags to many climbers.  Climbing overhanging rock, even with jugs, requires endurance and commitment.  Most climbers new to the Gunks drop down a few grades in their first leads to get a feel for the rock, the ratings, and to learn how to place pro in the horizontal cracks.  The best time to climb at the Gunks is during the fall: September and October are the prime climbing season.  Mid-October brings the fall colors to the area, and climbers will have to vie with "leaf peepers" for restaurants and places to stay in New Paltz.  Climbing in the spring is also popular, but tends to be wetter and more buggy.  Summer is hot and humid (don't miss the swimming hole), and winter offers a few climbable days. New Paltz weather forecast  The Gunks is one of the oldest climbing areas in the country.  Fritz Wiessner first climbed at the Gunks in 1935, and he and Hans Kraus put up many classic routes in the 1940s.  High Exposure, established in 1941, remains one of the most exposed and exciting 5.6 routes any climber will ever do, and should be on every visiting climber's tick list.  Most of the Gunks is part of the Mohonk Preserve, a land trust dedicated to preserving and protecting the northern Shawangunk Ridge.  Climbers must pay a $17 daily fee to climb at the Gunks, or else buy an annual pass for $90 (amounts as of 2011).  Stop at the Visitor's Center, on Rt. 44/55 just below the cliffs, for more information.  
getting_there: By Plane  The out-of-state climber may want to fly into Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), La Guardia Airport (LGA), or Stewart International Airport (SWF), rent a car, and drive to New Paltz.    Newark Liberty to New Paltz: 97 miles, 1 hour and 39 minutes.  Directions from Newark Liberty Airport to New Paltz Hostel  La Guardia to New Paltz: 87 miles, 1 hour and 38 minutes. Directions from La Guardia Airport to New Paltz Hostel  Stewart International Airport is  the closest commercial airport to the Gunks.  The airport is a quiet regional hub; you rarely have to wait in line, and you can arrive at the airport less than an hour before your flight.  Connections to and from here may be limited, however.  Stewart International to New Paltz: 22 miles, 28 minutes. Directions from Stewart International Airport to New Paltz Hostel  More on arranging transportation: Getting around  By Car  To get to New Paltz: take the New York State Thruway (Interstate 87) to exit 18 (New Paltz/Poughkeepsie). Pass the toll booth and go to the first traffic light. Turn left at the light onto Rt. 299 West. Follow 299 several miles into New Paltz, where it becomes Main St.  To get to the Gunks from New Paltz: continue on Rt. 299 for 7 miles until it intersects with Rt. 44/55 (The Brauhaus, Bistro and EMS are at this intersection). Turn right and continue about 1.5 miles up the hill to reach the Mohonk Preserve Visitor's Center.  Stop here for maps, information, and to buy daily or annual passes (you can also get passes from the rangers on the carriage road). The Warwarsing parking area, which provides convenient access for climbs on the right side of the Trapps, lies just beyond the Visitor's Center.  The West Trapps parking area, used to access the left side of the Trapps and the Near Trapps, lies up the hill, beyond the big hairpin turn, just past a steel bridge. There are also parking areas at the hairpin turn, and at the top of the hill just before the steel bridge, but these are posted as 30-minute parking only (may or may not be often enforced by the local or state police, depending on season and mood).  By Bus  Trailways has a bus terminal in New Paltz, right next to the New Paltz Hostel, but it's most convenient to have a car to get to the cliffs. 139 Main St. New Paltz, NY 12561 800-776-7548

area_name: The Trapps Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-trapps/105798818 
description: The Trapps is the largest and most popular cliff at the Gunks, with many excellent routes at all grades ranging from one to three pitches in height.  Almost three miles in length, it is home to many classic climbs of all levels of difficulty, and sports almost 500 routes.  It has many exceptional easy and moderate routes, and draws large crowds on weekends during the spring and fall.  The Grand Traverse Ledge (GT Ledge) starts halfway up the cliff near the route Easy Overhang, and runs north (right) with only minor breaks almost the entire length of the cliff.  A gravel carriage road runs the entire length of the cliff, and provides an easy walk below the cliff to get to your route of choice.  Access trails, marked with yellow paint blazes, are used to get to the cliff from the carriage road in less than 5 minutes.    The hardest thing for new climbers to the Gunks is to find the correct access trail from the carriage road to a desired route. In summer, the cliff is obscured by trees, so it's often difficult to spot the routes from the carriage road.  If in doubt, ask someone where to go; the locals are plentiful, friendly and helpful.  The cliff first rises tall above the carriage road at area known as the Uberfall.  Mohonk Preserve rangers sometimes hang out here on weekends, checking to see if visitors have their passes.  Water is sometimes available from a spring near the Uberfall, and a vault toilet is located nearby.  There is a kiosk with a message board here as well.  To accommodate the 300+ routes of the Trapps, we've broken down the cliff into areas around well-known routes and walls, and divided them by easily-identifiable features.  They are:  The Uberfall, including routes from the beginning of the cliff up to the vault toilet. Jackie and friends, covering routes between the vault toilet and the huge left-facing chimney of Miss Bailey. Frog's Head - the Arch, covering the Baby & Frog's Head, Drunkard's Delight, and Arch areas, to the major arete of Ribs. Strictly - Shockley's, roughly between Ribs and the major corner system of Three Pines. The Mac Wall (Something Interesting), from Three Pines to the huge orange right-facing corner of Asphodel. The Guides' Wall (Madame G's) includes routes from Asphodel to the Mantle Block just left of Raunchy.  V3 - Middle Earth covers the Raunchy, V-3, Cakewalk, Middle Earth and Thin Slabs / Thin Slabs Direct clusters. The Arrow Wall - CCK starts at the height of land near Red Pillar, past Arrow, Andrew, Moonlight, Cascading Crystal Kaleidoscope (CCK), and ends with Modern Times. High E includes its namesake, Insuhlation, Ants' Line, and Bonnie's Roof, up to the huge cleft of Silly Chimney. The Yellow Wall (Airy Aria) - The Seasons (The Spring) also covers the alcoves around around Ventre de Boeuf and The Sting, Double Crack, and the Seasons, ending with Blistered Toe. The Slime Wall starts with the unmistakable crack of Last Frontier, covers Simple Suff to Wasp, and includes the Moondance area. Sleepy Hollow covers the scattered routes and crags at end of the cliff. 
getting_there: From New Paltz, take Main St. (Rt. 299 West) to the T-junction with Rt. 44/55 (the Brauhaus, the Mountain Deli, EMS's guide shop).  Go right, up the hill.    There are two different ways of getting yourself to the carriage road. You can park at the Warwarsing lot, on your right just past the Mohonk Preserve Visitor's Center.

All the fixed anchors are relatively new and of high quality. Routes are clustered in 3 distinct areas.  Lisa Falls Buttress These slabs are particularly well-suited to beginner climbers or those just looking for a casual jaunt up the rock while being surrounded by the beauty of trees and a nearby waterfall. The routes here are among the easiest on the difficulty scale. Beginner climbers are cautioned to pay close attention to the protection rating for individual routes, as a few are runout.  Lisa Falls West This wall has sport routes on it that face northwest and are all shady in the morning.  Freedom Wall 3rd Class scrambling is required left of the waterfall to approach this area.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/smith-rock/105788989 
description: Smith Rock is Oregon's premier rock climbing destination, and one of the best sport climbing areas in the United States.  This world-renowned sport climbing mecca has more than once been at the focal point of the climbing world.  Extensive development took place in the 1960s, 70s, and 80s by locals and international climbers alike, who put up scores of classic climbs on the tuff and basalt cliffs; development continues to this day with new moderates and cutting-edge routes going up each year.  Ranging from classic beginner routes to hardcore testpieces on a wide variety of rock, there is truly something here for everyone.  Although best known for its sport climbing traditional climbers can find plenty to be excited about here as well.  Located in the high desert in central Oregon, Smith Rock State Parks cliffs and hillsides take a commanding presence over the surrounding terrain.  The main cliffs are made of volcanic welded tuff, and surrounding bands of columnar basalt lie above the winding Crooked River.  Smith Rock is a perfect weekend getaway for residents of the Portland area as well as a worthy destination for anybody exploring the Wests climbing.  The prominent walls overlooking the Crooked River are home to many of Smith Rocks most famous routes, but for those seeking some solitude and adventure there is plenty to be found on the back side or among the basalt columns in the Upper and Lower gorge.  Monkey Face, perhaps the parks most recognizable feature, sits proudly on the back side of Smith Rock with spectacular views of the Cascade Mountains and the arid landscape below.  It takes years to become familiar with all of the areas at Smith, and there is enough climbing here to allow even the locals to find new favorites every season.  There are over 1,500 routes at Smith but it's easy to get stuck in a cycle where you only climb the same 50 classics each season; a little exploring here to the less-traveled areas goes a long way.  Approaches are generally short and straightforward from the main parking lot, and a well-maintained system of trails provides easy access to all of the parks areas.  Please dont stray from the established trails; the visual and environmental impact of people scrambling up the hillsides can be enormous.  There is water available at the parking lot and a drinking fountain at the bridge, although they both get turned off during the cold months.  I've heard that the water from the sinks in the bathrooms isn't potable so bring your own to be on the safe side if the fountains are shut off.  Restrooms are available in the main parking lot, at the bridge, and the Phoenix Composting Toilet is conveniently located within sprinting distance of the popular walls on the front side of the park.  Please respect those around you, keep your pets under control, and pack out everything that you bring in.  If you've never been to Smith Rocks before, there is an overview map posted here  that can help you find your way around. The areas to the left are organized in the same fashion as the Watt's Guidebook, going to the left from Picnic Lunch Wall, to Monkey Face, and then across to Red Wall and towards the Monument Wall and around the gorge. 
getting_there: Smith Rock State Park is located in the town of Terrebonne, Oregon.  Take Smith Rock Drive East off of Hwy. 97 in Terrebonne, then take a left on 17th Street, a right on Wilcox Ave, and finally a left on Crooked River Drive to the main parking lot.  It's pretty easy to find, but here's a map just in case.  Driving time to Smith Rock State Park is approximately 6-7 hours from Seattle, 2.5-3 hours from Portland, and around 30 minutes from Bend.  The closest airport is 10 miles away in Redmond, OR.

description: These two immense formations at the western edge of the Wonderland Valley absolutely dominate the entire region and are visible from afar as easily recognizable landmarks.   One of the most popular destinations in the Wonderland, The Astro Domes hold an amazing collection of high quality routes on mostly excellent quality stone. Routes here range from 5.1 to 5.13 with single, two, three and even four pitch routes to challenge both body and mind. Climbing here is altogether different experience that will challenge your notions of Joshua Tree as nothing more than grainy slabs with it's soaring flake systems and intricate face climbing up steep thin crimps and edges.   South Astro Dome  has many stellar routes including Breakfast of Champions (5.8+), Solid Gold (5.10a), Piggle Pugg (5.10c), Such a Savage (5.11a R), Middle Age Crazy (5.11c/d), Stone Idol (5.12a R), Middle Age Savage (5.12a/b) and Mamunia (5.13a).   North Astro Dome  has it's share of quality routes as well - Figures on a Landscape (aka Monkey on My Back) (5.10b R), Astroturf (5.10d), Unknown Soldier (5.11b), Repo Man (aka Power Fingers) (5.12a R) and the Gunslinger (5.12a/b).  
getting_there: Park at the Uncle Willie's dirt lot and follow an old road east to a fork in the road and then make a left, bearing north, towards an old pink building (Uncle Willie's Health Food Store).    Head left into a wash and some trees and follow the wash as it curves left (west) and then just past an old retaining wall/dam makes a right heading north. Continue along the wash/trail as it meanders between formations forming a narrow valley. After 0.5 miles or so and just past Foolproof Tower you'll reach the southern end of the expansive Wonderland Valley where the impressive Astro Domes will come into view.  Shortly after entering the vally the trail will fork - take the left fork heading west. A bit of scrambling through some rocks will gain level ground near the base of the massive Don Juan Boulder. Circle around the north side of the boulder heading towards the South Astro Dome aiming for the left of two gold streaks on the face and follow slabs uphill that parallel the base of the dome.   The North Astro Dome is reached by continuing along the base of the South Astro Dome and then down a bit of rocky terrain to the base. The approach usually takes between 30-45 minutes assuming no routefinding errors are made.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/south-astro-dome-/105720741 
description: These awesome domes lie in the heart of the Wonderland of Rocks and sport some of the longest routes in the park.  Classics include Solid Gold (10a) and Such a Savage (11a).  The climbing is characterized by steep face climbing on small edges protected by bolts.  Remember though, that these climbs were put up in the days of the bolt-on-lead ethic, and ARE NOT SPORT CLIMBS.  Just because these routes aren't given an "R" (by tradition) doesn't mean you won't encounter significant runouts with dangerous fall potential: a small rack is usually useful to supplement the fixed gear on these routes.  The majority of the routes on these domes face northeast and thus can be quite cold in the winter and see little sun.  That being said a warm day in January brings ideal climbing conditions if you don't mind being a little chilly.  The South Astro Dome can be descended by 2 rappels from the top of My Laundry (one 60 ft and one 90 ft).   
getting_there: Directions are difficult in the Wonderland.  It is best to bring a good map to help locate the Astro Domes.  From the Barker Dam parking area, follow the trail north towards the Dam.  When you reach the lakebed, continue north through the lakebed (if dry) or cross at the dam.  Continue north through the Wonderland until you reach the enormous Don Juan Boulder.  At this point veer towards the South Astro Dome and clamber up slabs to a notch which provides an excellent vantage point of the walls.  Descend to the route of choice.

It features a number of moderate and classic lines, but it also provides easy access (read: short approaches). A good assortment of face and crack climbs make this one of the most popular areas in the park. Although there is a singular Echo Rock, the entire area, made up of several formations and granite corridors, is usually referred to by the same name. Very much worth a visit!    
getting_there:  The Echo Rock Area lies just northeast of the Hidden Valley Campground (Intersection Rock) area. There should be parking available next to the westernmost Echo formation.

description: Echo Rock is the huge dome closest to the parking area and a popular destination with climbers. Due to it's size the dome has been broken into separate areas to more easily navigate the wealth of routes.   The very popular Echo Rock - West Face is a slabby apron of rock with many single pitch face routes from 5.6 to 5.11+ as well as the occasional crack climb. Some of the popular routes include Double Dip (5.6) and Stichter Quits (5.7), Stick to What (5.9), Quick Draw McGraw (5.10a), Heart and Sole (5.10a) and Quick Draw McGraw (5.10b).  Being somewhat sheltered makes the Echo Rock - South Face a popular winter spot as it soaks up the sun and is a good spot to challenge yourself of a nice mix of crack and face routes. Some of the better ones here are Pope's Crack (5.9), Raked over the Coles (5.10d), Swept Away (5.11a), British Airways (5.11a R), Sole Fusion (5.12a) and My Idea of Fun (5.12d).  The EBGB Block Area is centered around a prominent block perched atop a shelf and visible from afar with Zondo's Perks (5.10a), EBGB's (5.10d), Jane's Getting Serious (5.12b) being some of the better routes.   The lesser visited Echo Rock - East Face can be a good spot to escape the crowds of the more popular areas as well as sample some lesser known routes such as Bambi Meets Godzilla (5.8), Closed on Mondays (5.9), The Menace (5.10b), Beadwagon (5.11a R) and Igor Prince of Poodles (5.11c).

Most routes have good anchors for a single-rope descent, and a few have a steep walk-off to the west.  I've set up Extreme Unction as a top-rope by rapping down from the top of Watchtower Proper which sits above Watchtower, but it's a big hassle.  The wall is rather long and quite large. It has been broken up into four sections, The Main Wall, The Watchtower Proper, The Tiers, and The Cove in an attempt to help navigate.  
getting_there: This is the first crag you will come to after hiking 15-20 minutes up the canyon from the trailhead on Timberline Drive.  The Watchtower wall comes right down into the stream so you may have to hop some rocks to keep your feet dry when the stream is high.  The steep gully on the right (west) end that you come to first is the walk-off for some of the first routes.  The routes are numbered west to east along the wall.

description: South Dakota may not be the first place that comes to mind for world class climbing, but few places are blessed with the amount of varied and classic climbing present in the Black Hills. With a strong history formed around many of the great pioneers of climbing.  In the 1930s On his way to free climb Devils Tower Fritz Wiessner stopped by and did several notable ascents in the area. Check out Oltons shoulder at Mount Rushmore the formation gets its name from the 1936 Original Route in which Fritz stood on Percy Olton's shoulders as a point of aid to gain the starting crack. Another story is on what was thought to be the first ascent of inner outlet. Fritz was climbing and noticed a ladder made from logs on the way up. Disgusted he knocked it off thinking he was bagging the first ascent.  Herb and Jan Conn some of america's first dirt bag climbers were passing through to Devils Tower and the Tetons. They were impressed with the natural beauty of the Hills. They liked the easy access and many unclimbed summits. They ended up settling in the Hills and mapping and recording the Black Hills climbing.Through the 1940s-1950s they established 219 first ascents in very bold style. This included a 60ft rope, tennis shoes, pitons,carabiners and bowline on a bight for a (harness). The Conn Diagonal is worth checking out as well as East Gruesome both should be on the top climbs list of the midwest. Remember the Conns always down climbed everything and never rappelled. It was good practice for the times when you get in over your head and needed to downclimb.    The Needles in the southern hills is host to runout face climbing on impressively skinny spires, the largest of which can be 3-4 pitches long.  Mt Rushmore is home to hundreds of well protected sport routes, and perhaps has the best concentration of memorable, high quality 5.6-5.9 sport routes on earth.  Old Baldy near Mt Rushmore is the premier bouldering area in the hills - spectacular enough to inspire Kurt Smith's film: Friction Addiction: Black Hills Gold.  Moving north, the granite fades away to limestone canyons and the odd chunks of sandstone. Outside of Rapid City offers a few obscure bouldering and rope climbing crags.   FALLING ROCK Small limestone crag near Rapid City provides a nice pump on vertical edgy limestone. The rock is a little chossy when compared to other limestone crags in the Hills but a couple of fun routes exist here. Some are even mixed routes.Expect majority to be Top Rope with a handful or sport / mixed routes. Gorgeous views of Rapid Creek and the surrounding hills and even a couple of bouldering problems. Please pack out all trash! Lots of teens tend to party here be the better person and don't litter!    THE ROCK MAZE along Nemo Road has juggy steep sandstone bouldering, and few crowds. The rock maze gets its name from the labyrinth made from the sandstone corridors.You could spend a day just in the maze itself bouldering. This is the premier ( most traveled and developed) sandstone area in the Hills. With a good 200 established boulder problems ranging from V0-V9    VICTORIA CANYON (THE VC) just minutes outside Rapid City on Sheridan Lake Road; which hosts impressive limestone sport climbing and is a contender with Rifle, Colorado climbing. Steep shelf like climbing on beautiful blue limestone that at times can mimic Spain. A true hardman crag with only a handful of 5.10s. It has been called the "5.12 mans crag" hosting numerous 5.12s and the hardest established line a Chuck Fryberger line called, Thin Red Line 5.13c. You can camp right above the canyon as well it is in National Forest Land.No water or open fires prohibited. Make sure to have a positive impact and pack in EVERYTHING. Stay on trails and don't trample vegetation in the canyon. Leave No Trace Ethics.    SPEARFISH CANYON The crown jewel of the northern hills is the Canyon, which has a huge concentration of high quality sport routes in the 5.6 - 5.14 range in a lovely picturesque canyon. Some of the best climbs tend to be in the 5.10-5.12 range on some of the midwest's highest quality be on steep limestone. In the winter, Spearfish Canyon has a number of good ice climbing routes as well.  And lastly, just over the state line in Wyoming is the iconic, monolith, Devil's Tower.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/custer-state-park/106058091 
description:   Located in the Black Hills of South Dakota is a climbing area like no other, The Needles. From Sylvan Lake a road called the Needles Highway winds through spectacular and spell binding towers and spires. From this road climbers can access a playground of unparalleled face climbing on ever narrowing spires by way of quartz crystals ranging from tiny to hand sized. The area is steeped in a rich history dating back to Fitz Wiessner's accent of the Totem Pole in 1936. The area was then home to the prolific Herb and Jan Conn, two climbers way ahead of their time, who put up over 200 first ascents from their first visit in 1947 and eventual move to the area in 1949. In the 1960's climbers such as Royal Robins, John Gill, And Henry Barber put up routes that still wow climbers today with their high "pucker factor". Locals such as Paul Muehl John Page, And Bob Archbold made their contributions to the Needle's catalog of bold climbs during the 70's and into the 80's with the likes of Pete Delonney.The Needles has long been know for its purist ethics, which has made for some wild climbs and a Needles' staple, the infamous simul-rap. As Jan Conn said,"You can climb anything in the Needles, if you have the guts."       Custer SP is a world class destination not only for the climbing but also the absolute beauty of the place. Once there, the friendly people of Custer, the interesting scenery, and the relaxed park staff will make it hard to leave.       While buying my $15 7 day pass, I told a ranger why I was there. While we prepared to pull away he smiled and said, "You guys can go anywhere you want!" Yeah, if we have the guts. 
getting_there: Once in Custer take Hwy 89/385 east out of town and then left on to Hwy 89 north to the Sylvan Lake entrance to Custer SP. From here is where the Needles Hwy starts and heads south.

description: The Donner Summit area of the Sierra Crest has climbing on granite rocks ranging from small to hundreds of feet. Both cracks and face climbs coexist here, and there are some kick-ass climbs of both sorts. The Donner Pass climbing season is from mid April until whenever snow closes the road in November or December.  Donner's 7000' elevation means that even during beautiful summer days a surprise storm is possible, so be prepared.  Lodging  Camping near the climbing is illegal, but doesn't seem to be too severely enforced. If that troubles you, seasonally there's camping on the opposite side of Donner Lake (see Donner Memorial State Park's website for details), and both cabins and hotels accommodations in from there to Truckee, which is an ample source of nearby food and entertainment.  Granite Flat Campground opens earlier each year than Donner Memorial SP. It is located a few miles south of Truckee on highway 89. It currently costs $22/night for a single vehicle site. It's not the most remote campsite as it is directly adjacent to 89, but has decent toilets and well water.  Access  In 2014, the Truckee Donner Land Trust and the Access Fund jointly launched the  Save Donner Climbing campaign. The following year, it purchased formerly private land for public conservation and access, which includes the Black Wall and other nearby cliffs.   CRAGS is the local Access Fund affiliate that helps supports this area.

description: High above to the North, hidden from Highway 50, sits the lonely Phantom Spires, and many surrounding rocks.   Amongst a barren rock field you will find many traditional routes, along with some more difficult sport and mixed routes in an excellent, yet unsheltered setting that's almost eerie at times.  Watching other parties climb is easy, since there are absolutely no trees surrounding the spires.  Wind can be unbearble, but because they face south, you can climb here from late fall to early summer before it gets too hot.  The black and white granite of The Phantom Spires will remind you of Yosemite, but like most Tahoe granite, isn't as glasslike.    Camping: around the the lot, just past the parking area.  Bring a 4X4 to access if it's been raining, or cross your fingers and drive REALLY carefully with your lower (not low!) clearance vehicles to get in on the 1+ mile long access road.  If the access road is snowed in, or if you can't get in with your vehicle, you can always walk in, which is a very pretty and awe inspiring view of the surrounding valley and the Phantom Spires. 
getting_there: From the West:  Take Highway 50 to Kyburz, which is 31 miles East of Placerville.  From Kyburz, continue East 4.9 miles to the marked Wrights Lake Road, which is a left turn.    Continue using the directions below.  From the East:  Head approximately 20 miles West on Highway 50, 4.1 miles past the small town of Strawberry (and Lover's Leap), to Wright's Lake Road, which is a right turn.  Continue using the directions below.  Once on Wright's Lake Road:  This will wander up a around for a while, getting narrower as it climbs.  After 2.3 miles, the Phantom Spires will leap into view.  As soon as you can see the spires, take the next left onto an unmarked gravel logging road that's REALLY easy to miss. This road heads downhill from the road and moves more in line with the gradient around the valley, and can be seen from the paved road below the spires if missed.  Follow the gravel road (slowly in 2wd vehicles!) until the road ends in a parking lot about 2 miles in.  There is a pullout about 1/2 way in on the road if you feel that your vehicle can't take the road, and this will shorten the longer approach.  The mapquest map below will get you to Kyburz.

Most of the activity here is on the Hindu, the Mongoose, and Sari - a cluster of three towers right next to Onion Creek Road.  There are also many walls and towers along the slot canyon leading to the mystery towers which sport some fixed anchors and have a great deal of new route potential.  As with all areas on Cutler, be wary of loose rock, bad anchors, and scary free climbing.

description: Seeing the Mystery Towers for the first time is an awe-inspiring experience.  One gets the sense of something sacred: perhaps only a tiny portion of the human population has ever laid eyes on them, even though they are less than a mile northeast of the Fisher Tower parking lot!  Layton Kor, Huntley Ingalls, and George Hurley were probably the first (climbers) to discover them - from the summit of the Titan in 1962.  After some unsuccessful attempts, the Doric Column and the Citadel were first summitted by Hurley in 1969; a year later the Gothic Nightmare was conquered by Bill Forrest and Don Briggs.  Since then, many new routes and smaller towers were climbed by these guys as well as Rob Slater, Keith Reynolds, Alan Stevenson, Matt Laggis, Crusher, Tony Wilson, Kevin Chase, Duane Raleigh, and others.  The towers are Cutler Sandstone (the Fisher stuff), capped by Moenkopi.  Of the Doric Column, Hurley said "Belaying in a vertical flute in this rock is like standing below a loading spout at a sand and gravel works."  Expect mud or dry mud, advanced and innovative aid, including but not limited to, bat hooks, ring angle claws, beaks and peckers, fishhooks, bugaboos, warthogs, ice axe tosses, dwarf tosses, and general lassoing skills.  Enjoy! 
getting_there: Viewable from the top of the Titan or Top of the World Overlook, but accessible from the Onion Creek road (see that description).  Check out Bjornstad's "Desert Rock III" for a detailed description of the approach and a general topo of the area.

area_name: Hell Roaring Canyon Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/hell-roaring-canyon/106319075 
description: Hell Roaring Canyon lies about 5 miles north of the Island in the Sky district of Canyonlands National Park. Its one of 4 canyons in this area that drain into the Green River from the east and it hosts a number of interesting climbing objectives in its 12ish mile length. The region is administered by the BLM and is currently under threat of development by the oil and gas industry.   This canyon has a long history as evidenced by the Barrior Canyon Style pictographs in its upper reaches and the 1836 inscription near the mouth of the canyon by French-Canadian trapper D. Julian. The first climbers to explore this area were Ron Olevsky and Dave Monduea who made several trips into the canyon in 84 that ended for reasons ranging from weather to rockfall. On Halloween, Ron returned alone and soloed a 4-pitch line on The Witch calling it Midnight Rider. The next year, Ron and Dave returned with Dale Kruse and climbed The Warlock, which is likely the most impressive tower in the canyon. Other towers in the canyon that are of interest to climbers include The Cauldrons, Corner Tower, and the Kachina Spires.   The rock here is wingate and although the towers have been climbed, the potential for new routes along the canyon rim is extensive. Despite this and the fact that Hell Roaring Canyon has been listed in at least 4 guidebooks, you are likely to have the place to yourself if you choose to climb here. Come prepared for an adventure.  
getting_there: There are three approaches to Hell Roaring Canyon. All approaches begin from HW 313.   Mineral Bottom Approach- (for Corner Tower or routes near the mouth of the canyon) From HW 313 turn west onto Mineral Bottom Road which, after a dozen miles on dirt, drops you down to the Green River via the Horsethief Trail switchbacks. (Its the same approach as for Moses to this point.) Turn right at the bottom and follow an old mining road upstream past the mouth of Mineral Canyon and for several more miles to the mouth of Hell Roaring Canyon. It is possible to drive up Hell Roaring Canyon for a couple miles but a landslide blocks further vehicular traffic. Note: The road along the Green River is often impassable. A high clearance 4x4 is required for this approach.   Rim Rappel Approach (for The Witch, Warlock, Cauldrons, or routes in the middle section of the canyon) From HW 313, turn right on Mineral Point Rd. (This is the road with the Horsethief Campground. It is 1/4 mile before the Mineral Bottom Rd. if youre driving toward the Park on 313. You will know youre on the right road because the 60-site campground will be on your left just after you leave HW313) From here the approach requires some attention if its your first time. Mark you mileage when you turn onto Mineral Point Rd. At about 3.8 miles you want to stay left on the better road. This takes you past a bluff on your right. About 3.2 miles later (or 7 miles from HW313) you pass a small tower at the end of the bluff with a wide crack splitting it. From the tower, backup 50 meters and look for a rough road going left and then continue across the desert . You will come to a second bluff on your right after about 1.3 miles. Take a right here (road gets rougher) around the end of the second bluff and drive straight at the rim and the towers. The road ends at a campsite. A 4x4 is recommended for this approach though you could probably get a Subaru out there if you were motivated. The rim is a short walk from camp. To find the rappel anchors, hike to the rim and scramble down the first tier to a point where the towers extend away from you in a row. Look to your left for an obvious gash (cairn) that takes you down one more level. From here scramble down and left past a small tree to a small alcove containing two bolts with chains. Use caution.    Spring Canyon Bottom Road Approach  (for The Kachina Spires or climbs in the upper section of the canyon) If driving toward the Park on HW313, turn right on Spring Canyon Bottom Rd. (this is a dirt road) 8.2 miles from the junction of HW313 and HW191. You will pass a BLM Kiosk and parking viewpoint on the left just before you reach this road. Follow this road for approximately 1 mile and then go straight/left at the Dunbinky Well Road junction. Continue along Spring Canyon Bottom Rd for a few miles until you cross a cattle guard. Immediately after the cattle guard there is a small dirt road that veers off to the left and goes for 200 meters to the rim of Hell Roaring Canyon. The Kachina Spires are obvious from the rim.

South of the Fraser River and north of the international border, there are important north cascade peaks in British Columbia.   British Columbia's North Cascades have the two best faces in the entire Cascade Range; Mount Sleese and Steinbok Peak.  Yak Peak's face also looks better than Liberty Bell, Bear Mountain, Index, or Mox Peaks.

description: Alberta is the epicenter (or epicentre) of Canadian Alpine climbing with countless snow and ice covered peaks, glaciers and famous north faces.  Alberta is also famous for some of the best ice climbing in the world.  Fortunately, Alberta is also well rounded and has sport and trad rock climbing a-plenty.  The limestone and quartzite in the river canyons in the Canmore area probably have Canada's greatest concentrations of sport routes.  Trad cragging is perhaps a little more limited than some other areas as the limestone of famous peaks like Yamnuska have great history and great routes but less solid rock; the climbing is more adventurous than a granite-trained tradster might be used to. 
getting_there: Calgary provides easy access to Canmore, Banff, Lake Louise and all of the surrounding areas.  Edmonton provides access if your destinations are further north.

area_name: Banff National Park Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/banff-national-park/105934221 
description: Banff National Park is Canada's first and most famous National Park. People come from all over the world to sightsee, hike, camp, raft, ski, scramble and of course climb year round.  The alpine climbing is clearly the highlight of the park. Many world famous peaks and tough ascents are located within the boundaries of the park. There are countless summits for the aspiring alpinist to attempt, some easy scrambles, some 5.9-M4-A4 unrepeated horror shows. Many of North America's finest alpinists and climbers cut their teeth climbing Banff's peaks.  The ice climbing in the park is also world famous, with a lifetime of ice available almost year round, from road-side cragging to 2000' WI6 routes. The typical ice season lasts from Mid-November into May and June (depending on how desperate for ice you are).  Rock climbers have a lot to choose from as well. Though the rock is fairly chossy (some have described it as the worst rock in North America that still gets climbed), the routes are many from small sport crags to huge alpine rock routes. The best quality rock is found in the quartzite of Back of the Lake at Lake Louise, whereas big, aesthetic routes can be found in palaces like Castle Mountain, Mt. Louis and the Tower of Babel. 
getting_there: Banff National Park is located along the Trans-Canada highway running from Calgary, AB to Vancouver, BC. The easiest way to get in is to fly into Calgary International Airport and rent a vehicle; the drive is about 70 miles to the park boundary. Bus service is also avialble from Calgary and places beyond.

description: Jasper National Park is the largest National Park in the Canadaian Rockies.  Within its boundary lies most of the Columbia Icefields and many of the highest peaks in the Canadian Rockies, such as Columbia, Forbes, North and South Twin, and Alberta.  Mt Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, is just off Jasper National Park toward the NW end (it is so important it is in its own Provincial Park).  In the summer huge campgrounds fill to capacity with everyone from RV cruisers to hikers, climbers, and bikers.  The town of Jasper is the hub of this region---it is quite a bit smaller and more remote feeling than Banff.  In the winter the place feels much more remote although still connected to Banff and Calgary by the Icefields Parkway.  In the winter the place is relatively empty aside for the lucky residents and the occasional visiting ice climbers. 
getting_there: Driving or riding north from Banff along the Icefields Parkway is by far the most common way to reach Jasper National Park.  A National Park pass is relatively expensive, but gives you entrance into both Banff and Jasper National Parks.  If you are visiting during the summer for a week in a car this pass will cost you over $100.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-cirque-of-the-unclimbables/105905649 
description: The Cirque of the Unclimbables offers amazing granite rock climbing in a remote, beautiful setting. Found in Nahani Provincial Park just over the western border of the Northwest Territories, the Cirque is pretty out there. No roads lead to within a hundred miles of the Cirque.  Often likened to the Bugaboos but without all of the snow and harder to get to, the Cirque holds many spires and walls. Most are suitable for climbing, but Lotus Flower Tower and Mount Proboscis stand out as gems. Mid-to-late summer offers the best climbing weather and also offers up to 20 hours of daylight because of the Cirque's northern geography.   Fairy Meadows, the traditional basecamp for all routes in the Cirque except the more remote Mount Proboscis, is a magical, lush, well, meadow. Granite boulders, some house-sized, dot the meadow and present rainy-day bouldering opportunities and shelter for tents. Most objectives in the area are a one-hour walk from the meadow. However, those who plan on climbing Mount Proboscis should plan on a much more involved approach from the meadow, one that takes a number of hours and involves a climb through What Notch, as Proboscis actually lies in a subsidary cirque.   Goerge Bell's excellent and informative site answers most questions about the area:  home.comcast.net/~gibell/cirqu... 
getting_there: This is the hard and expensive part. Unless you are masochistic, it is necessary to charter a float plane to fly you into the Cirque. Warren Lafave's company, Kluane Airways is the primary service for the Cirque. He owns the Inconnu Lodge, a very high end fishing resort, so those who chose to fly with Kluane often are treated to food and lodging at this up-scale establishment. Warren usually stashes a sat phone in the Cirque in order to coordinate trips back to civilization. More info can be found at: kluaneairways.com/unclimbables...  We drove to Finlayson Lake, which is about two hours north of Watson Lake in the Yukon Territories. From here, a float plane picked us up and flew us to Glacier Lake, the major drop-off point for the Cirque. From Glacier Lake, expect a long slog up interminable talus to Fairy Meadows. So, from the lake, follow a meandering trail generally west until you hit the talus at the base of Mount Harrison Smith, a mile-high hunk of bad granite. Take a hard right and follow the talus generally north until you hit Fairy Meadows. It took us a solid half-day to get from the lake to the meadow.   It is also possible, though more expensive, to charter a helicopter to drop you off at Fairy Meadows, thereby bypassing the talus slog. If I ever go back, I am definitely getting the helicopter. After negotiating the talus a few times while shuttling loads, I came to the conclusion that the helicopter is absolutely worth the extra cost.

area_name: Northern Arizona Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/northern-arizona/107447440 
description: Northern Arizona (NAZ) is a vast and varied landscape of rolling ponderosa forests, high elevation plains, and sculpted sandstone deserts. Home to the Grand Canyon, the Painted Desert, the Mogollon Rim, the San Francisco Peaks, and some of the best whitewater on the Colorado River, Northern Arizona is quite literally a sacred land to the Navajo and Hopi, as well as many a rock climber....   Climbing in Northern Arizona began in the late 1950's with the first ascent of the Mace in Sedona, done by visiting climbers, Bob Kamps, TM Herbert, and Dave Rearick.  In the years to follow many of the major formations and summits throughout Northern Arizona would be pioneered, and an age of vast exploration was set in motion.  As Tim Toula writes in his classic guide, A Cheap Way To Fly, "I entered thru the historical gate of the Flagstaff climbing scene in the fall of 1978 when climbing was still much more of an underground sport than it is today.  There was a mystique about climbing then that was hard to grasp.  Perhaps it was because there were so few climbers then.  Names like Baxter, Coats, Davidson, and later, Murray, Gault, and Mattson floated thru the air like phantoms.  Their names heard often, but their talents seldom seen". Check this book out for a more comprehensive slice of the early history of Northern Arizona climbing. At twenty some years old, this is still one of few sources for local areas.  Now a days that list of names has grown tremendously as a constant stream of talent pours out of Flagstaff, which is the heart of the Northern Arizona climbing scene.  The age of exploration that began in the late 50's has not only continued to this day, but has blossomed into a collective energy that really defines the community here. There is always something new to check out.   Take a look at Joel Unema's, grassroutesclimbing.com/. for stories and photos about local areas, and interviews with local route developers. It's a cool project and will hopefully turn into a means to record and revel in the colorful history of Northern Arizona rock climbing.     	  	              	      	  	    Steve Grossman (during his Royal Robbins phase) turns the Tralfamadore Roof on the second ascent in 1976. Paul Davidson belays. Volunteer Canyon, AZ   	   Trad Climbing Northern Arizona has long been held as a bastion of traditional climbing, and for good reason.  With the sumptuous single pitch basalt crags like *Paradise Forks, The Overlook, *Volunteer Canyon, and *The Waterfall, Northern Arizona is a hard rock trad climber's dream with easily accessed four star routes.  Add to that the gritty, character building back country adventures of the Grand Canyon National Park, the mysterious quartzite Hualapai Wall, and the soft stone spire paradise, the *Sedona Area, you might just find yourself slipping into a heart pounding state of trad daddy nirvana.      	  	              	      	  	    Worth The Weight The Gold Wall, Paradise Forks  Arizona  Photo: blakemccordphoto.com   	   Sport Climbing If you are looking for sport routes in Northern Arizona, you won't have to look too hard. To the east lay crags like the Winslow Wall and *Jacks Canyon south of Winslow. Around Flagstaff you will find great crags like  The Pit, The Doctor's Office , the Mt. Elden areas Solitude Canyon and Red Dragon, as well as,  The Peaks Crag and the Hobo Jungle on the San Francisco peaks. Way up north are the unique limestone crags the Virgin River Gorge and the The Arizona Strip. Sport climbing is alive and well throughout Northern Arizona.  Whether you are looking for steep pockets, or off vertical crimps, the list of fine crags and excellent routes is sure to keep you happily swinging through the air, one way or another....

Flagstaff is world renown for it's pocketed limestone roofs at areas like Priest Draw, but these roofs are tucked away in folds all over Northern Arizona. And though the double digit lines keep adding up at places like the Hinterlands and Cherry Canyon, even the beginning boulderer is going to find a slew of premiere challenges at crags like Buffalo Park, Lake Mary Areas, and  Turkey Tanks. From the Fontainebleau like slopers of Kelly Canyon, to the sharp dacite crimps of  Gloria's,  Northern Arizona is a boulderer's paradise.     	  	              	      	  	    Matt Gentile at one with his environment on Renegade Roof.  Photo Ken Etzl   	  Considerations Northern Arizona has some of the most pristine and unpolluted crags of anywhere I have been in the US. Please help us keep them that way.   We tend to take care of our crags, and most of the routes listed here have adequate anchors or other fixed hardware, if they have any at all. However, one may encounter a few old, rotting pins in places like Sedona and in the Grand Canyon. Much of the original hardware in Secret Canyon on Mt. Elden is old and suspect. Crags that see a lot of action like Jacks Canyon, The Winslow Wall, and The Pit also have aging fixed hardware that wasn't all that great to begin with. I believe an era of route maintenance with glue-in bolt replacement looms before us.  Many of the anchor systems on single pitch routes throughout Northern Arizona employ the "fixed carabiner" style anchor which is specifically set up for easy, safe lowering. If one of the two carabiners is worn past the point of common sense, please leave one of yours in place and take the old one home with you. They make great conversation pieces....   And while a lot of the routes listed here are well traveled, it can be said that Northern Arizona is full of adventurous climbing. Always check your holds, especially on the softer stone.

Flagstaff also sees an average of 100" of snow a year.... Yes despite most folks impressions of Arizona, we represent the winter months quite well here in Northern Arizona. Good winter climbing can be had throughout Northern Arizona at the Arizona Strip crags way up north, as well as, The Pit and Higher Solitude Canyon right around Flagstaff, and Jacks Canyon to the east. Winter is also the season for Sedona climbing. If the cold has really set in many retreat to the Central Arizona crags.   Springtime is notoriously windy, and has been known to drive people mad! Especially in the high deserts. Luckily, this is really the only detracting element of the season. Otherwise it's prime time for crags like The Waterfall, Paradise Forks, The Overlook, The Red Dragon, Lower Solitude Canyon and many, many more as perfect temps can easily be chased down.  The summer months bring about an average high of 88 degrees during July. Then it's Monsoon Season to the rescue! Flagstaff itself receives an annual 21" of rain a year, and much of it comes during the Monsoons which are powerful storm systems. Monsoon Season typically lasts through September. Attractive areas this time of year include The Hobo Jungle, The Peaks Crag, West Elden, The Winslow Wall, and more.  And of course, our favorite season Fall, does not disappoint in Northern Arizona. With usually sunny, moderate temperature days, most of our premiere crags are in perfect conditions. Whether you are chasing around the fall colors on the San Francisco Peaks, or marveling at the otherworldly dryness of the desert crags, Fall in Northern Arizona should not be missed.

area_name: Real Hidden Valley Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/real-hidden-valley/105720636 
description: Real Hidden Valley is a circular-shaped area - I'm not sure if box canyon is quite the precise term for it, but hopefully you get the idea.  It is home to some J-Tree super-ultra-mega classics such as the delightful Sail Away (easily protected 5.8 crack), the adrenaline-pumping Run For Your Life (5.10b scary runout face/friction), Clean And Jerk (5.10c crack), Leave It To Beaver (5.12a - usually done as a TR), the masochist's dream Fisticuffs (5.10b fists and larger), and of course the ever-popular  Illusion Dweller (5.10b perfect crack).  Sports Challenge Rock and The Thin Wall are excellent (read: popular) top-rope areas, each with a high concentration of fun routes.  Locomotion Rock has a few short, easier routes for the aspiring leader.  Several excellent bouldering problems lie just beyond the parking area (both west and south).  Areas and climbs found outside the canyon itself have now been relocated to Real Hidden Valley Vicinity. 
getting_there: A short walk south along the now paved road from Hidden Valley Campground puts you in the Real Hidden Valley parking area.

area_name: Loveland Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/loveland/105720612 
description: Loveland consists of myriad boulders and crags on the hillsides above washes 1 - 2 miles north of Split Rock. Most of the routes in this area were established by seminal climbers in the 1980's and ascend slabs, faces, and cracks of varying widths on fair to excellent quality rock. Vector (5.11c), one of the best trad climbs in the Park, is located in Loveland.   Even though this area is relatively close to Split Rock, the approach to many of the crags involves boulder hopping and/or navigating through desert scrub and cacti on steep terrain. However, many fine routes may be found on crags that require circuitous or cumbersome approaches. 
getting_there: The best way to access Loveland is to park at Split Rock and follow the trail that heads north. Looking north, the Tiger Rocks and Bond Boulders are easily seen near the trailhead. As soon as the trail veers in a northwest direction toward the Morongo Man Cliffs, continue north in a wash and over rolling terrain for a mile to the Tiger Rocks and Bond Boulders. The other crags are found on the slopes on either side of the Desert Queen Wash which is located about 1/2 mile north of the Bond Boulders.

description: The Geology Tour Road is an 18 mile dirt road loop which winds it's ways through the southern end of Queen Valley and the western end of Pleasant Valley where numerous rock formations can be found on either side of the Road. Popular areas include the Virgin Isles, East Virgin Isles, The Lost Pencil and Jerry's Quarry.   The unpaved, but occasionally graded, Geology Tour Road is a fairly good dirt road with lots of washboards and ruts in the first few miles and then a fair bit of soft sand after that. While having a 4WD vehicle is not a necessity it is advisable to have a vechicle with a bit of clearance and one that you feel comfortable driving over the odd rough spot. Be aware that some of the parking spots have a fair bit of soft sand which can spell trouble for those without 4WD, especially if trying to turn around in it. Better to keep the vehicle pointed downhill and drive the extra bit to Squaw Tank where a good turnaroud exists. 
getting_there: The turnoff for the Geology Tour Road is located in the center of the Queen Valley and across the road from the turnoff for the Desert Queen Mine Area. See the individual crags for more detailed approach information.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/virgin-islands-area/105720645 
description: The Virgin Islands, despite it's ease of accessibilty, remains one of the quieter and less frequented climbing areas in the Park. The crowds are fewer here and the solitude, especially away from the road, is quite noticable. The first documented climbing was done here in the early 1980's by the ubiquitous Tony Yaniro and Vaino Kodas who climbed the bulk of the best crack lines. Since then a number of quality crack and face climbs have been done with limited development continuing to this day.   Some of the recommended cracks here include the fairly enjoyable wide to hands crack of Thumbs Down Left (5.9), Light Sabre (5.10b) with it's clean corner and exposed crack higher, Between a Rock and a Hard Place (5.10b) for those seeking a full body workout, Cedric's Deep Sea Fish Market (5.10d) a tricky thin crack, Perpetual Motion (5.10d) a steep hand crack, Centurion (5.10d) for those whose like it wide and Human Sacrifice (5.11c) for those who want to step it up a notch.  A sampling of recommended face routes include the relatively unknown Hodad Arete (5.10b), the sandbagged Raker's Blaring Hat Rack (5.10d) which climbs a free-standing spire, Hot Lava (5.11a) with it's delicate arete moves, the somewhat obscure Walking on the Moon (5.12a), Rapture of the Steep (5.12b) with it's steep face goodness, the overhanging arete of Dictators of Anarchy (5.12c) and the continuously difficult and excellent New World Order (5.13b A0). 
getting_there: The Virgin Isles are reached by drving down the Geology Tour Road about 4.2 miles and parking in any of several pullouts along the side of the road. The formations are easily visible from the road and hiking times vary from 5-20 minutes with some scrambling typical. Take care if driving a 2WD vehicle to park pointing downhill. Should you get stuck you can continue driving further down the road to a turnabout at Squaw Tank (1.1 miles down the road) which has a large area suitable for turning around.

area_name: The Sentinel Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/the-sentinel/105720693 
description:  The Sentinel is the largest, tallest and most impressive formation in the Real Hidden Valley, although it is outdone for title of highest cliff, that honor being taken by the Tumbing Rainbow Formation.     One of the few rocks in Joshua Tree that lends itself to multi-pitch routes, it has a good selection of routes from intermediate to advanced. There are also some bolted routes for the hardman who doesn't mind supplementing fixed gear with some additional pro. The rock is generally solid and clean, with very few exceptions.   This large, triangular fin of rock faces primarily east by northeast and west by southwest - as a result, there is almost always something to choose in the shade or sun, whichever suits the season and/or weather. The north and south facing aspects are narrow ridges that provide an scambling descent from most of the routes, or access to a rap station.    There are some classic lines on this rock, but the majority of the better lines are intermediate to advanced in difficulty. By reputation, Fote Hog (5.6) is the wall's best easy line. If you can climb a little harder, there are better routes to start your tour with - the under-appreciated Western Saga (5.9), the thought-provoking Ball Bearing, (5.10a) and a must-do super classic Illusion Dweller (5.10b). Still harder classics include Desert Song (5.11b) a bold line  across the lip of a huge roof and Where Eagles Dare (5.11d) a bouldery thin crack start with a challenging face finish.   Hardman routes such as The Chameleon (5.12b), The Tarantula (5.12c), Some Like It Hot (5.12c) and The Scorpion (5.13b) are reputed to be great, although seldom see traffic.  
getting_there:  Enter the Real Hidden Valley from the south, past Gateway Rock. Once inside the valley proper make a left (heading mostly north) until you reach a point on the trail near the center of the base of the Sentinel's East Face. To access the west face continue on the trail until you pass the Sentinel formation by perhaps 50 feet to the north before turning left (west) and walking about 30 feet to a trail that turns left (south) again and doubles back along the west face. The Hidden Cliff lies across from the right end of the west face.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/sports-challenge-rock/106325842 
description: This formation is, by its position and merit, the centerpiece of the Real Hidden Valley. There are more routes with stars to be done on the various faces of this wall than on most other formations in the area. The variety of climbing alone is remarkable with cracks, faces, overhangs, roofs and even a girdle traverse to be done.  The routes are generally on solid, chocolate-colored stone and with routes facing all directions there is always something in or out of the sun depending upon the temperature. The fixed anchors on top can easily be reached from above by almost any of the routes for a rap to the ground. Note: Vogel's 1992 guide has a picture of the west face (page 154) that's numbered incorrectly by eleven.  Classics here include the popular and thinly protected Sphincter Quits (5.9), the thuggy Clean and Jerk (5.10c), the tenuous What's It To You (5.10d) and the classic-looking Leave It To Beaver (5.12a). 
getting_there: Enter the Real Hidden Valley via the south and look for a huge grey and tan bulbous rock in the center of the loop trail. Approach via a well-worn trail from the south, which splits to go to the east face (right) or west face (left). Some easy scrambling is required to reach the base of a few of the routes.  Please do not shortcut the trails here, as the pressure of too many people doing so is harder than necessary on the desert plant life; there is no shortage of established trails to follow.

description: Many excellent formations are to be found in this extensive area that generally has short easy approaches. Many classics are found in this area that's not far from the campground but feels like it is. Cracks, faces, mixed routes and even some sport climbs are here.   Some of the many classics here include- Super Roof (5.9+) and Sidewinder (5.10b), Hot Rocks (5.11b), Grain Surgery (5.10a), Apartheid (5.12a), Jugline (5.11c), Rollerball (5.10b), and Blood of Christ (5.12a).   Additionally good bouldering is scattered throughout the area as are some local curiosities like The Hobbit Hole and The Iron Door Cave.    
getting_there: The Outback is the large collection of formations that are found to the north of Hidden Valley Campground. They extend from near the Quail Springs Road (Steve Canyon) east towards Echo Cove (Peyote Cracks wall) and north to Dutzi Rock. Approaches vary but most are made via Hidden Valley Campground as this typically affords the shortest walk.

description: The Steve Canyon Area lies along the western edge of The Outback and to it's east is the large open area that characterizes that area. Steve Canyon, the namesake of the area is the most popular spot here and within it's sheltered canyon walls are a number of quality routes worth seeking out. Watanobe Wall faces Park Blvd. and offers a fair number of mostly crack climbs with a minimal approach. The Hot Tub is another crag facing the road with a mix of crack and face climbs on it's sunny flanks. Cereal Rock is fairly overlooked although it's many routes are not especially inspiring.  
getting_there: Cereal Rock, The Hot Tub and the Watanobe Wall are most easily approached by parking along Park Boulevard in any of several paved pullouts adjacent to the rock and following trails to the base of your chosen crag. Approaches take from 5-10 minutes usually.   Steve Canyon can be approached from Hidden Valley CG by walking north along the west face of the Old Woman using a well-worn trail which leads directly to the mouth of Steve Canyon proper. This approach takes about 5-10 minutes depending upon which portion of Steve Canyon you plan on visiting.   Additionally, it's also quite easy to access Steve Canyon from The Outback proper by heading west along the north side of The Blob and then south past the east face of Sidewinder Rock, circling around the southern end of that formation to arrive at the mouth of Steve Canyon.

description: Steve Canyon is formed by a series of rocks that are oriented in a north-south direction; numerous routes exist on both the east and west sides of the formation inside the canyon proper as well as on the outer faces of the canyon.  From the mouth of the canyon inwards are the following:  Left Side (E. Facing)   The Orc Wall             Tennis Shoe Block Super Roof Wall   Right side (W. Facing)     Sidewinder Rock - West Face   Grain Surgery Wall  Mud Wrestling Wall  Popular amongst those in the know, this can be a good place to escape the winds and even soak up the sun depending upon the time of day. A good balance of crack and face climbs exist here from 5.4 to 5.12b meaning something for just about everybody.   Some of the better routes here include Skinny Dip (5.7 R), Super Roof (5.9), Grain Surgery (5.10b), Sidewinder (5.10b), The Decompensator of Lhasa (5.10c), Diamondback (5.10c) and Jumping Jack Crack (5.11a).    
getting_there: Two of the popular approaches for getting into Steve Canyon are as follows:  Hidden Valley CG Approach - Starting from the large lot at Hidden Valley Campgound walk along the west face of the Old Woman using a well-worn trail which leads directly to the mouth of Steve Canyon proper. This approach takes about 5-10 minutes depending upon which portion of Steve Canyon you plan on visiting.     Park Boulevard Approach - Park in one of several paved turnouts along Park Blvd. a short distance to the north of the turn into the Hidden Valley CG parking lot and follow a marked trail east to the mouth of Steve Canyon. The west face of Sidewinder Rock and it's distinctive slanting dike system is a good landmark. This approach takes about 5-10 minutes depending upon which portion of Steve Canyon you plan on visiting.     It's also quite easy to access this area from The Outback proper by heading west along the north side of The Blob and then south past the east face of Sidewinder Rock, circling around the southern end of that formation to arrive at the mouth of Steve Canyon.

area_name: Sheep Pass Area Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/sheep-pass-area/105720579 
description: Sheep Pass is a large, vague area near the southeastern end of the broader Lost Horse Valley (technically, the pass, several miles east of Hidden Valley Campground on the main park road, divides Lost Horse Valley from Queen Valley, and the Sheep Pass group campground lies on the Queen Valley side of the pass, but most of the climbing is on the Lost Horse side of the pass). Incidentally, if you're coming with a group, Sheep Pass is the place to try to get a campsite -- but make your reservations way in advance.  The most prominent formation in the Sheep Pass area is the huge Saddle Rocks, which sit high up on the side of Ryan Mountain (which provides the eastern border of the Lost Horse Valley). Saddle Rocks can be seen from miles away, and their faces contain some of the longest climbs in the park. Other smaller areas in Sheep Pass include Cap Rock, Television Wall, Cowboy Crags, and the Ryan Campground area (notable for some nice bouldering, and of course the aptly-named Headstone Rock).  For a sparse area, however, Sheep Pass has several must-climb classics. Walk on the Wild Side (5.7+) is a classic, slabby 3-pitch ascent up the east face of Saddle Rocks, and the Headstone's SW Corner (5.6) and Cryptic (5.8) are deservedly popular routes to the top of a truly unique formation.   
getting_there: As noted above, Sheep Pass generally lies on or near the main park road, a few miles east of Hidden Valley Campground.  Headstone Rock is best accessed from within Ryan Campground, and turnouts for Saddle Rocks, Cap Rock, and the group campground are clearly signed.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/zion-national-park/105716799 
description: Zion is a spectacular park with excellent routes for a wide range of ability levels.  It is most noted for its long wall routes on amazing sandstone.  There are many good entry-level grade IV's and V's like Prodigal Sun, Touchstone Wall, and Moonlight Buttress.  There are also many challenging lines that will test the seasoned wall rat.  There are plenty of short, one or two pitch routes for those who don't want to venture too high off the deck.  As a National Park, Zion charges $25 for a seven-day pass or $80 for an annual pass (good at all National Parks and covers entry fees at most other federally-managed lands).  A $10 fee is charged for a bivy permit for each wall you do.  Overnight bivy permits are obtained from the rangers at the visitors center.  Or you can book online using the Zion online permits. You still have to pick them up but at least it is booked.  Beginning sometime in March all cars have to be parked at the Visitors Center.  Shuttle buses have to be ridden to access anything in the canyon during the high season.  They are fairly efficient and operate from 5:45am until 11:00pm.  There is camping at the Watchman Campground inside the park, as well as lodging at the Zion Lodge (not for the standard, dirt-bag wall rat).  Free camping is available in many areas just outside of the park in the Springdale and Rockville area.  Some of these sites have been really trashed.  Feel free to clean them up so that free camping continues.  Springdale is loaded with all of the necessary amenities for a long stay.  There are restaurants, grocery stores, showers, hotels, bars, and even a gear shop.  The weather is stinking hot by May.  There are sometimes nice cool spells, but the most comfortable weather usually occurs in the spring and fall.  There is about a 3,000 to 4,000 foot vertical rise between valley floor and canyon rim.  For this reason, weather can be different depending on your current elevation. 
getting_there: Zion is located in the southeastern corner of Utah between St. George and Cedar City.  Coming from the North, take exit 27 off of Interstate 15 going to Toquerville on Highway 17.  17 joins Highway 9.  Continue West on Highway 9 following the obvious Zion National Park signs to Springdale and the main park entrance.  Coming from the south, take exit 16 off of Interstate 15 onto Highway 9 headed towards Hurricane.  Continue west on Highway 9 to the park entrance.

area_name: Black Velvet Canyon Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/black-velvet-canyon/105731948 
description: Black Velvet Canyon could well be called the crown jewel of Red Rocks.  The black, varnished rock is of the highest quality and its walls host a high concentration of excellent and longer trade routes.  With walls over 2,000 feet high, the canyon receives little sunlight and as such can be quite a bit cooler than other areas.  Area classics include Epinephrine (V 5.9, 12-18 pitches), Prince of Darkness (5.10c), Frogland (5.8), Triassic Sands (5.10c), Dream of Wild Turkeys (5.10a), Yellow Brick Road (5.10a), Refried Brains (5.9) and many others that I haven't yet climbed.  As expected, the classics tend to be crowded (especially Frogland, Prince of Darkness, and Epinephrine).  It is recommended to have an alternative in mind should there be a queue for your desired route.   Many routes require two ropes to rappel.  Camping is NOT permitted at the trailhead (parking area) and violators will be ticketed.  Legal camping can be found 2 miles east of the Visitor Center on Hwy 159 for $10 per night per site.  IMPORTANT: Waste bags are provided by the Las Vegas Climbers Liaison Council in order to reduce human waste issues at the crags and boulders.  Please feel free to take one, use as directed, and dispose of in any trash receptacle.  Please do not leave them lying around, and do not throw them in the toilets at the parking areas.  The project was funded primarily by the American Alpine Club's Cornerstone Conservation Grant, with additional funding from the Access Fund and Mountain Gear.  Please do your part to be a good steward of this amazing climbing area. 
getting_there: Unlike much of the Red Rocks area, Black Velvet Canyon is NOT accessed via the Scenic Loop Road.  Instead, from the Red Rock Canyon Campground (a.k.a. "13 Mile Campground"), drive southeast on Hwy 159.  At the intersection with Hwy 160 (gas station w/ good beer selection), turn right (west) for approximately 4.5 miles towards Pahrump.  Be on the lookout for a pullout and road on the right-hand (north) side.  There is a paved parking lot here (called the "Latenight Trailhead" by the mountain bike set) with rest rooms. Follow the dirt road north from the parking area.  After a mile or two the road makes a left turn (west) at a usually closed gate and ends at a parking area near the mouth of the canyon.  Although fairly bumpy, 2WD vehicles **should** be okay on this road.  Park and follow the well-defined trail from here.  Count on a half hour to 1 hour for approach.

description: Tumwater Canyon lies along HW2 on the approach to Leavenworth from Steven's Pass. The canyon is the northern companion to Icicle Creek.  Similar in character and rock type (quartz diorite) to Icicle Creek, the biggest difference between the canyons is the presence of Highway 2, the major route connecting Leavenworth to western Washington, and a source of pesky road noise at some crags.  There are fewer crags in Tumwater than Icicle, but some great ones-- Castle Rock and Midnight Rock offer longer trad climbing, while Clem's Holler and surrounding crags offer numerous sport climbs.  There is camping in the canyon at Tumwater Campground, and several campgrounds in Icicle Creek Canyon, a short drive away.

description: Between the populous climbing destinations of Yosemite and the Tahoe area lies a more obscure section of the Sierra Nevada. It includes better known areas such as Table Mountain and the Calaveras Dome Area, as well as seldom visited or climbed mountain rock. Like all regions the span the breadth of the Sierra Nevada, it can be climbed in all seasons by moving to a currently comfortable elevation.  Much of this region falls within the boundaries of the  Stanislaus National Forest, including some overlapping wilderness areas at its borders.   The last major towns you'll pass on the west side of this region are where the three highways leave highway 49 in the Gold Country: Jackson (for highway 88 climbing areas), Angels Camp (for highway 4), and Sonora (for highway 108). All three are historic and thrive on tourism. You'll find food, gas, and at least basic outdoor supplies at all three. Sonora has at least one outfitter selling climbing gear.  Sonora Pass' Highway 108 has its own dedicated hard copy guide book, and a website to supplement that.  The Carson Pass areas major climbing spots are kindly documented by Tim at the Climb Highway 88 website. 
getting_there: The three main trans-Sierra highways of Carson Pass (highway 88), Ebbetts Pass (highway 4) and Sonora Pass (highway 108) are used to reach these areas by visitors.  All three of these state highways close during the winter, in response to current conditions. See the Cal Trans website for these. State Road 4 conditions. State Road 88 conditions. State Road 108 conditions.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/calaveras-dome-area/105876771 
description: Calaveras Dome and surrounding areas are near Salt Springs Reservoir, on the Mokelumne River, to the southwest of Lake Tahoe.  This area offers excellent multi-pitch free climbs and a few grade V big-wall routes. 
getting_there: The fastest way to get there is via Ellis Road (Panther Road is significantly longer, and more dirt road). The road is mostly paved (though lots of potholes). There is one section where the road washed out, but it has been well repaired and is passable by any car type. The signage for the turnoff for Ellis Road off of 88 is not super-obvious (especially if you are heading west on 88)-- you are in the right place if you see bathrooms right by the turnout.

description: Split Rocks is named for the large split rock (go figure) immediately north of the parking area.  Please do not climb on Split Rock proper.  The two most popular areas in this part of the park are Future Games Rock and Isles in the Sky.  Must-do routes here include the slightly overhanging Bird Of Fire (5.10a) and the unique Rubicon (5.10d).  The  Future Games Area  has several nice lines, notably Invisibility Lessons (5.9), Continuum (5.8+), and The Bendix Claws (5.11a).  The somewhat off-the-beaten-path Isles Corridor hosts a handful of fun cracks with not so memorable names, while the Cling or Fling Corridor offers a few cool steep sport routes.   
getting_there: The Split Rocks Area is located just beyond Jumbo Rocks Campground along the main road. Driving east, turn left (north) 1.2 miles past Jumbo, and park at the end of the cul-de-sac.

Overview of the regions  Map modified from original in visitnh.gov/information/about-...   	 Actually though, the rock in this state comes in many forms, from the rounded boulders of *Pawtuckaway in the South to the clean fractured granite of *Cannon Cliff  in the North. We even have a world class sport climbing area, though the cliffs at *Rumney are mostly schist. On the other side of the mountains, North Conway has its own scene and two of the best trad cliffs around. Cathedral and *Whitehorse Ledges are just minutes from town. All of this within a state that is small enough to fit into some of your National Parks out West.    Whether you consider yourself a hard core traditionalist or a sport climbing wunderkind, there is a wealth of climbing to be found in this small state. Plus, there's some die-hard Libertarian blood around here, so don't expect to pay any taxes. And fall around these parts can be pretty close to heaven. 
getting_there: Despite its diminutive size, New Hampshire should be found on most maps of the U.S.   Manchester hosts a major regional airport and would be the airport of choice for areas in the western part of the state (Rumney, Cannon etc. about 1 1/4 hr drive).   Portland, Maine has a good airport, and is only about 1 1/4 - 1/2 hr drive to areas like Cathedral and Whitehorse in the eastern part of the state. [Take Maine Rt 22W to Rt 114N to Rt 25W to Rt 113N to Rt 302W in Fryeburg ME, then 302W into North Conway; do NOT take Rt 302 all the way, esp. in summer)      The Boston airport is less than a three hour drive from most points in the state.

area_name: *Cannon Cliff  Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/cannon-cliff-/107340274 
description: Cannon Cliff is the tallest and most respected cliff in New England. The climbs are long, the weather is bad, and the rock is exfoliating. Every climber who heads up to do a route on Cannon understands that the undertaking is a considerable one.   This is not to say that the routes are bad, however. The popular routes ascend pristine granite and can be over ten pitches long. Just don't stray from your chosen route, as you may find yourself in one of Cannon's many heavily eroded vertical gullies.   Rockfall is a common occurrence on the cliff. The Old Man, a natural outline of a face in the rock and New Hampshire's famous state symbol, fell off the cliff a few years back. An entire pitch, the Whaleback Crack, parted from the face in the 1990's and created a swath of fresh talus at the base.    	  	              	      	  	    This is the rough estimate of the areas i split cannon in to...    	   Located in Franconia Notch, the cliff faces east and many a climber has been caught unawares by fast-moving storms coming from the west. Plus, a long talus approach leads to the base and can be heinous if the talus is wet or snow covered.   Do not let the above description dissuade you. Cannon offers the chance for the experienced climber to find alpine serenity on a remote, unforgiving, and challenging wall.   
getting_there: All roads lead to Interstate 93 and I-93 runs through Franconia Notch. The big cliff is on the west side of the road. You can't possibly miss it.   The parking area is on the north end of the cliff. It is only possible to access the lot from the southbound side of 93. If you are coming from the south, head past the lot and get off on the next exit (the Tramway exit). From here, reverse directions and head south into the lot.

description: Easy access, classic climbs, and easy descents make the Near Trapps a popular area at the Gunks, second only to The Trapps in climber visits.  The cliff is 30' to 200' feet high, and sports almost 200 routes.  The most popular area is the north end (closest to the parking lot), with many classic routes one after the other.  The middle section of the cliff has loose rock and not many good climbs; be careful of rockfall in this area.  More good climbs are found at the far (south) end of the cliff, a 20-to-30-minute hike from the parking lot.  To descend from climbs on the right end of the cliff, follow the cliff-top trail to the climber's right, circling around the cliff and back to the base by the route Kansas City. For climbs on the left end of the cliff, follow the cliff-top trail to the climber's left, and descend the gully at the end of the Near Trapps. Many climbs have rappel anchors which allow descent after one or two pitches without going all the way to the top of the cliff. 
getting_there: From New Paltz, take Main St. (Rt. 299 West) to the T-junction with Rt. 44/55. Go right, up the hill. Pass the Mohonk Preserve Visitor's Center and continue past the hairpin turn up to the top of the hill.  Park at the West Trapps Lot, and walk up to the steel bridge.  It is not recommended to park at the "30-minute" lot on the left at the top of the hill, unless you'll only be staying less than 30 minutes;  tickets are $125.  From the steel bridge, instead of going up the stone stairs to the carriage road, walk along 44/55 itself back towards town for a few hundred feet, and also cross the road (carefully).  Look for a foot trail that heads south from the road, just past the road cut and before the guardrail. In a few hundred feet, this trail brings you to the base of the Nears, just to the left of Kansas City.

area_name: Redgarden Wall Rock Climbing  
area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/redgarden-wall/105807689 
description: The Redgarden Wall is the premier crag in Eldorado Canyon State Park.  It hosts the greatest number of routes, the finest lines, the tallest routes, and it is the largest cliff in the park.  Without Redgarden Wall, Eldorado Canyon might just be another climbing area.  Unless you are truly only seeking the true high-end of climbing difficulty, there is probably ample quantities for you here at this cliff alone.  In fact, some people have moved here simply because Eldorado Canyon and Redgarden Wall are here.  Probably, every American climber who is anyone special has touched this stone.  There is truly something special about this place.  The native Americans knew this.  This was recognized by the earliest modern visitors; however, it was probably not until the 1950s that climbers became bold enough to venture onto its steeper faces.  The climbing here is characterized by excellent sandstone with interspersed short areas of lower quality rock.  The dominant style of climbing is traditional, face climbing, sprinkled occasional cracks, dihedrals, and roofs with various era fixed protection.  Strong protection skills, route-finding skills, and verve are essential on this crag.  A solid, mental control is often required for success and good health here.  Repeated, uncontrolled falls commonly used at modern sport climbing areas are not advisable in many places.  For the purposes of this organization, the division of the crag is arbitrary but involves looking at the cliff in terms of obvious distinct features without splitting it into too many sections (goal of 40ish routes or less per section).  This approach can best be appreciated by stepping back and looking at the crag with fresh eyes and looking for obvious divisions.  Please understand that no one system will be perfect nor necessarily one better than others.  However, the lines used here to split the crag are the 1) the great dihedral right of the Naked Edge (Redguard & right - S Buttress); 2) the roof like area at the bottom of Redgarden Wall and the routes that go through it (Roof Routes); 3) the Lower Ramp and routes below it (Below Lower Ramp); 4) the obvious saddle between Tower One & Tower Two and the well-known route that splits it (Ruper); 5) the obvious large dihedral that splits Lumpe Tower and Tower One (Dirty Deed and the best continuation below it - West Chimney). Obviously, there are going to be challenging lines at the edges of these arbitrary boundaries and those that cross through multiple sections such as Rosy Toit, Roving for Love, Ruper to Grand Giraffe etc.  The likes of Bird, D. Johnson, Shepard, Kor, Dalke, Ament, Culp, Erickson, Wunsch, Ferguson, Bragg, Coyne, Breashears, Webster, Briggs, Hill, Griffith, Hersey, and so many more have wandered here....  The complete list is a virtual who's who in Colorado climbing have left their marks here with first ascents, first free ascents, first solo ascents, repeats, etc..  There are just so many terrific lines here.  Obviously, this list will unintentionally miss some favorites and is inevitably incomplete.  Some that resonate between climbers include: Swanson Arete, 5.5; Icarus, 5.6 s; Rewritten, 5.7; The Bulge, 5.7 s; the brilliant Ruper, 5.8 s; The Great Zot to The Zot Face, 5.8+; Alice in Bucketland, 5.8+ s; Redguard, 5.8+ s; Touch 'n Go, 5.9; Green Slab Direct, 5.9; The Green Spur, 5.9; Anthill Direct, 5.9 s; Italian Arete, 5.9 s; the ever-popular route, The Yellow Spur, 5.9 to 5.10b; Darkness 'til Dawn, 5.9+; Grand Giraffe, 5.10a; the airy Rosy Crucifixion, 5.10a s; Blackwalk, 5.10b s; The Serpent, 5.10b s; Art's Spar, 5.10c; Grandmother's Challenge, 5.10c; Super Slab, 5.10d; Psychosis, 5.10d s; Temporary Like Achilles, 5.10d s; T2, 5.10d s; Le Toit, 5.10d s; Disappearing Act, 5.11a; Guenese, 5.11a; the verve-requiring route, The Diving Board, 5.11a; the historic Kloeberdanz, 5.11a s; Vertigo, 5.11b; the ultra-classic The Naked Edge, 5.11b; Pansee Sauvage, 5.11b s; Evangeline, 5.11b/c A1; C'est La Vie, 5.9 P1 or 5.11c; Back in Black to Black Top, 5.11c s; Doub-Griffith, 5.11c s; Love Minus Zero, 5.11c s: Jules Verne, 5.11c s/vs; Le Boomerang, 5.11d; The Contest, 5.11d; Silver Raven, 5.11d; Mellow Yellow, 5.11d s; Fire and Ice, 5.12a; the intimidating route, The Wisdom, 5.12a s; Apple Strudel, 5.12a/b s; Downpressor Man, 5.12b; Scary Canary, 5.12b s; Wasabe, 5.12c; the impressive Psycho, 5.12d; Genesis, 5.11a P1 or 5.12d s; the necky & controversial Paris Girl, 5.13a Kloeberdeath, 5.13b; Desdichado, 5.13c; probably Eldo's hardest, The Undertaker, 5.13d.  It would be wise to plan your descent before you leave the ground since none are completely obvious.    Some lines here can be rappeled.  Others may funnel rappelers down lines like the rappel below The Naked Edge first pitch.  Many of the lines that go to the top can be descended with at least 2 methods.  1) You can downscramble the East Slabs Descent (plan - to be fleshed out with its own separate description)  low 4th class- note this is exposed, lengthy, and particularly slippery when wet.  Also, the last bit can be challenging in the spring with a wet slab finish or funky downclimb down a chimney.  2) You can rappel the Swanson Arete or Dirty Deed rappels.  3) You can go to rappel the Chockstone Chimney rappels which take you to the top of the Upper Ramp or Meadows.  Here, you can rappel the Vertigo rappels (60m or 2 ropes) or carefully descend the Upper Meadows to the rappels below The Naked Edge. 4) You can ascend to the top and far left end of Redgarden Wall and down scramble the gully at the top.  Note, you may wind up a long way from your gear and comfortable shoes.  So, come here, respect the rock & your fellow climber, soak in the history, climb to your heart's content, fill your spirit, and enjoy the gift of freedom.  Redgarden Wall is part of what makes Colorado wonderful. 
getting_there: To access these routes, you park at the E end of the park.  You walk up to the bridge.  You cross the bridge.  Your exact approach depends on the exact section of wall you wish to climb.  So, read more details on the exact approach for the section you wish to climb.

description: This "area" is for alpine rock climbing in Colorado.  Alpine is probably the true "Mountain" Project terrain.  These routes truly lie in the mountains.  This is the terrain of the alpinist, the all-arounder.  Generally here, you must be comfortable in whatever the environment will throw at you.  Alpine is the home of the marmots and pikas in the warmer months.  In the colder months, this is the land of the frozen.  Scattered here is the terrain in which weather, exposure, season, loose rock, ice, snow, route-finding, lightning, precipitation, and altitude can dramatically affect one's experience.  All these climbs involve heights of at least 8,000 feet and are above treeline.  With these factors comes increased risks but potential for increased rewards and memories that can last a lifetime. 
getting_there: These climbs cover the state from the Crestones, the Sangre de Cristos, the Mosquito Range, the Collegiates, the Sawatch, the San Juans, the Gores, the Front Range, the Elks, the Indian Peaks, the Mummy Range, the Never Summer Mountains, Rocky Mountain National Park or whatever range you wish to include.  Look high and you will find them.  You will drive but then you will hike, since most all of these will require some extended approaches.  Some will require overnight trips.  Nearly all will have season considerations for the majority of climbers.

description: Tahquitz and Suicide Rocks are the premiere multi-pitch traditional crags in Southern California and offer numerous climbs of all levels from one to seven pitches in length.  The rock at both Tahquitz and Suicide is a high-quality granite that varies from smooth and nearly featureless in spots to rough and grainy in others with most of it being somewhere in the middle and quite excellent. Loose rock is generally rare at Suicide Rock but the north side of Tahquitz is notorious for loose rock.    The season typically runs from mid to late spring through mid to late fall although with a mild winter the season can be extended in either direction. Suicide Rock with it's lower elevation tends to be free of snow earlier in the spring and be hotter in the summer.  Please note these are traditional crags and although sport routes do exist at both rocks they are the exception. It's important to keep in mind that even fully bolted routes requiring nothing more than quickdraws tend to be runout and somewhat serious leads.  
getting_there: From LA or Palm springs via Interstate 10 take Highway 243 from the town of Banning 24 miles south to the town of Idyllwild. After a stop sign (your first since leaving Banning) make a left onto North Circle Drive, the second left, and follow it to another stop sign. Make a right and then your first left onto Fern Valley Drive and follow the signs to Humber Park.   From the San Diego via Interstate 215 take Highway 74 to the town of Hemet, from which it's 14 miles to the small town of Mountain Center and the junction with Highway 243. Drive 5 miles to the town of Idyllwild and make a right onto North Circle Drive (just past The Fort) and follow it to a stop sign. Make a right and then your first left onto Fern Valley Drive and follow the signs to Humber Park.

area_url: http://www.mountainproject.com/v/lumpy-ridge/105744228 
description: I hesitate to write about Lumpy, I grew up spending my summers in Estes Park and started my climbing career 7 years ago at Lumpy.  Since then, I have seen it grow immensely in popularity and is headed the way of Eldo (i.e. crowded as hell); however, this growth is mainly from the weekend warriors, on the weekday climbing is more reasonable.  Lumpy is awesome, the climbs are moderately long, two to five pitches on average, and take place in a spectacular setting with views of Longs and RMNP.  The climbs are spread out on a number of unique formations, the most popular being The Book.  Sundance, far at the end of the ridge, is the tallest cliff at 700-800' and has awesome classic climbing with a long approach that deters the lazier climbers.   The climbing at Lumpy is interesting.  I have always felt it to be quite stiff.  Pushing the grades here in the 5.10 and 5.11 range often requires fiddling with tricky pro on less than vertical flared cracks while fighting a heinous calf pump.  The pitches tend to be full length and take place on highly technical granite that requires solid footwork. There aren't too many beginner climbs here, Lumpy climbing is concentrated in the 5.9-5.11 range.  That said there are a few classic outings in the 5.5-5.8 range.  These include:  Magical Chrome Plated Semi-Automatic Enema Syringe (5.7, this is a good, although not classic climb), Batman and Robin (5.6, great beginner climb or first lead), White Whale and Hiatus (5.7, totally classic), Kor's Flake (5.8, longer route), Osiris (5.8, you will either love or hate this "wider" climb), Melvin's Wheel (.8+, great climb), Pear Buttress (.8+, best 5.8 on the Ridge), Cackle Crack (5.8, short).  Climbing in the 5.9-5.10 range opens up tons of classics, these are a very few. J-Crack (.9, spicy with a runout 5.8 traverse, time tested classic), Loose Ends (.9 awesome), George's Tree (.9, very typical Lumpy climbing), Mainliner (.9-, DO THIS CLIMB), Orange Julius (.10a, varied climbing), Climb of the Ancient Mariner (.10a classic face), Fat City (.10+ famous classic, a sandbag), Cheap Date (.10a) and Outlander (.10+), great finish to routes like Pear Buttress  and J-Crack ), Gollum's Arch (.10a, sandbagged and sustained with many different sizes on it).  In the 5.11 range, almost every route is good, yet many are tricky to protect as they are thin seams and faint features. Stretch Marks (.11a, a little scary), Living Dead (.11b, very finicky protection), Backbone Arete (.11c, a well bolted yet very hard slab), Finger Lickin' Good (.11a), Corner Pump Station (.11c).  I haven't done these two, yet they, obviously belong on this list.  For those with minimal time to spare, Little Twin Owls has good toproping with a classic Finger Crack (.11) that should not be missed.  There is good bouldering just before Little Twin Owls, and just after the turnoff for The Book.  Two good routes for the solid .10 trad leader are on Checkerboard Rock, a fifteen minute approach.  These climbs are Ziggy's Day Out (.10+) and Checkerboard Crack (.10b), both these routes are short and require a lot of skill at placing pro.  Checkerboard Crack is classic Lumpy climbing, flared, insecure, sustained, and very hard to protect.   
getting_there: Take US 36 to Estes, head across the lake and go straight at the first stoplight you meet.  At the second stoplight, head straight, the road curves left here and passes the Stanley Hotel.  Take a right 1/4 mile after the Stanley on Devil's Gulch Road.  Head straight on this road for a mile or so (Lumpy Ridge should be quite obvious in front of you) until it begins to curve right. When it curves right, there will be a wooden gate that says McGregor Ranch.  Take the road through the gate for a half mile, to the Lumpy Ridge parking lot.  The new trailhead will be located east of the Twin Owls Trailhead just off MacGregor Ave.  The gravel access road lies just west of the Gem Lake Trailhead.  This will result in an additional 0.7 miles to formations west of Twin Owls.  This will shorten access to crags east of Twin Owls.  Happy hiking.

description: In the opinion of many, the Book is the finest cliff on Lumpy Ridge.  It certainly offers the best non-wide crack climbing (if you like them wide, head for Twin Owls!).  Many long, striking crack and dihedral lines grace the complex cliff, which rises to heights of 600'.  Due to the cliff's predominant less-than-vertical aspect, many of these lines check in at under 5.10, though there are plenty of test-pieces at 5.10 and 5.11 as well.  A few bolt-protected 5.12s are scattered about, and true hardpersons can attempt the 5.13+ crack line of Country Boy, first freed by Tommy Caldwell.  Some recommended routes would include  Pear Buttress at 5.8;  Loose Ends and J-Crack at 5.9; Fat City, Cheap Date, and many others at 5.10, and any of the 5.11 routes such as Howling at the Wind that ascend in or near the Howling dihedral.  The Renaissance Wall and El Camino Real are said to be good 5.12 routes.  The Book also has many 1-pitch routes (including first pitches of longer lines) which are a good alternative if the weather looks iffy for a longer route.  Fixed anchors seem to come and go, however...  DESCENT: From the very top of the cliff, one can walk east a ways, beyond a steep broken area, and then contour back to the base (long and easy).  Many routes end just above the "Cave" on the right side of the Book.  From here, scramble out on a narrow ledge east to its end, and downclimb a groove (or do a short rappel from a tree a little ways out).  From the bottom of the groove, go southeast (easier but longer) to walking terrain, or head southwest down more grooves to a cairn at the top of a east-angling chimney/gully.  Go down that and one more chimney to walking terrain.  Like the east slabs descent in Eldorado Canyon, this shorter descent should not be attempted in the dark or when wet unless you are familiar with it.  No rappel route exists that I know of and none is needed.  
getting_there: From the new parking lot, take the west trail towards the old Twin Owls parking lot ~0.6 miles.  The Book is a complex cliff; here is an attempt to describe it. Starting from the east, as you view the south-facing cliff from the Black Canyon trail, note a broken area of slabs and gullies (the Cave descent).  Just left is the beautiful J-Crack Slab, sporting the very long parallel crack lines of Femp and J-Crack, and several other excellent crack lines to their left.  Above are some reddish overhangs on the right, a cavernous overhang (The Cave!), and to the left, a short, steep headwall capping the cliff. ~45-50 minutes to approach.  The next major landmark is the Howling at the Wind dihedral, a massive, overhanging left-facing corner which extends about halfway up the cliff.  Many superb and intimidating free lines attack this feature and the overhangs nearby.  Left of it are narrow, smooth slabs, with an arching roof band about 150 feet up.  The next section is obvious: an area of deep grooves which extend the entire length of the cliff, known as the Pages Wall.  Left again are two massive chimneys running the entire height of the cliff (Book of the Dead Chimney and Requiem Chimney).  A narrow prow between the two, known as the Isis Buttress, offers many excellent routes.  The western-most chimney includes the brilliant Renaissance Wall, home to numerous hard bolted & naturally protected climbs.  Left of the west-most chimney the cliff becomes broken and unappealing for a long stretch and no routes are recorded here.  Below this broken area is The Bookmark, a subsidary cliff about 400 feet high, described elsewhere.

description: This area features a range of climbs from 5.3 to 5.10. 
getting_there: The trailhead is just below the start of the Devil's Slide hiking trail.  Hike down a short hill to the creek and then follow the trail as it wraps around a hillside. After approx. .3 miles take a left trail climb that climbs the steep hillside above to the base of Tahquitz.

description: This area is around the right side of Tahquitz which includes the Open Book area. This area offers some short climbs and is warm on cool day but heats up during the summer. It starts with the Open book Dihedral and keeps moving right and up. This area offers a variety of climbing, from good moderates to stout to even aid climbing.  The usual descent is the Friction Route, but there is also a rappel route starting on the 2 bolt anchor atop the Open book to a 2 bolt anchor for Green Arch and then down to the ground (you will need  2 ropes for this rappel). 
getting_there: From Lunch Rock head up and right to the base.  Then follow the base around and right until you see the Open Book Dihedral.  This is the start of the area.
