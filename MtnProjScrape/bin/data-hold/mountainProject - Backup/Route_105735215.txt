route_description: Located in the right section of Buck's Bar dome, this climbascends a broken crack system on the left side that heads upabout 15' to a large rest where you can eat lunch if you'reso inclined. A commiting almost roof move brings you into avery wide vertical crack, which is very obvious from below.  An excellent route, and the commiting move is scary, butdoable, especially with protection.
