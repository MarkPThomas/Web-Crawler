route_description: The route starts with overhanging good hands crack , than thin hands, than off fingers. Just before crux when it become hard- there is the thin crack on the right which can be use for stemming. The crux for me is huge rich for good fingerlock just above small horizontal crack in the middle of the route. This section is similar in difficulty to Anticipation on Arch rock.  After the middle crux- route ease up to thin hands. The upper thin crux marked in book also 10d - felt at least two letters easier than first one. This route is my nemesis -I tried it 4 times and never redpointed.  I even know the pro in order , but it is not help. I've been always   trashed at the point to make  move on first crux
