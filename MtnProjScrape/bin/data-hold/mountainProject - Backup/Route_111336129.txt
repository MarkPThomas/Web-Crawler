route_description: This route combines Grant's Crack with the 5.6 chimney above the small belay tree. If you know the name of the route, please leave it in the comments so they I may update it.  Climb Grant's crack or Oak Tree Flake to the belay tree. Second pitch is 5.6-7 depending on where you go, but it's all laid back. Continue up above chimney and slightly right. If you have a 70m rope, you can belay from the large ledge next to the walk off for Swan Slab Gully's 3rd pitch. 60m brings you to a slightly awkward belay on some dirt and grass mounds with large flakes.  There is an old rusted bolt atop the 5.6 chimney.
