route_description: Start below a lone tree on the east side of Hogsback.  The first pitch ends at the tree and is very easy.  From the tree the second pitch contains some 5.5 moves, but due to the low angle of the rock it doesn't feel that way.  A 60 m rope gets you from the tree to the end of the second pitch.  Use a 50 m and you will be belaying from the crack itself.  Not that this is a bad thing as it helps to build confidence in belaying without a ledge.  The third pitch is again very easy to climb and protect.  Upon reaching the top, walk off to the left to return to more climbs or to head for climbs at the Leap.
