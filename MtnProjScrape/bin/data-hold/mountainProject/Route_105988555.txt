route_description: The "3rd class" scramble is best protected with a rope as the ledge and corner are dirty and loose.  From a tree in the corner above the 3rd class a stunning hand crack  behind a rock flake is gained and climbed over the bulge to a pod. Getting into the pod is the first crux. Offwidth up this, can be strenuous, reaching the upper chimney. This chimney is more difficult than 5.7 and there is a delicate set of moves to get up and over left to the belay bolts.
