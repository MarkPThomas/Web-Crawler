Morning sun and afternoon shade make it easy to plan your climbs according to the weather or clothing.  Some of the better routes here include the elegant curving crack/flake of Buissonier (5.7), the delicate and sparsely protected Mama Woolsey (5.10a R) and the always popular, slightly slippery and well-protected Papa Woolsey (5.10b).
