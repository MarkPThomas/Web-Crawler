route_description: Three pitches of climbing that gets better and better with height.  Finishes on a cool ledge with excellent views.  All in all, straight-forward and fun.  P1 (5.6, 70') Jam and stem your way up 70 feet of cracks in a gully.  Belay from a big oak tree on a spacious ledge.  P2 (5.5, 130') Perhaps the least aesthetic pitch on the climb.  Follow a crack in an obvious corner.  After approximately 80 feet, step right and follow cracks up mostly-4th class terrain.  Belay from a big oak tree on a spacious ledge.  P3 (5.5, 120') Walk up the gully and head right for about 40 feet along a grassy ledge.  Climb up to meet a left-slanting hand crack.  Climb the crack until it ends.  Traverse right for 25 feet on an unprotected slab (5.4?).  Climb a 5.5 finger crack to the top.  Belay from trees and bushes.
