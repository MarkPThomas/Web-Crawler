Mount Baldy is the summit capping the north-south ridge which divides <a href="http://www.alta.com/">Alta</a> and <a href="http://www.snowbird.com/">Snowbird</a> ski resorts.<br>
<br>
A short and easy approach hike with minimal elevation gain, along with excellent views of the ski resorts and Little Cottonwood Canyon, make this an excellent peak for beginning or intermediate hikers.  More advanced hikers can combine this summit with a number of multi-summit ridge scrambles, including the challenging <a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/4803/object_id/3428">Bullion Divide</a> ridge traverse.<br>
<br>
Mount Baldy is located in the <a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r4/uwc/">Wasatch</a> National Forest.<br>
<br>
In nearby Albion Bason to the east of the summit lies Secret Lake.  The spelling of Secret Lake varies, with some maps and publications using the alternate "Cecret Lake".<br>

<br>
The most scenic approach (and the smallest elevation gain) for a hike of Mount Baldy is by way of the Albion Basin Secret Lake trailhead.<br>
<br>
Take the 6200 South exit (exit #6) off I-215 and follow highway 190 south-east approximately 2 miles to the intersection with Big Cottonwood Canyon road.  Continue straight through the stoplight and follow the road another 4 miles to the mouth of Little Cottonwood Canyon, where an electronic billboard on the right provides current road and/or weather conditions.<br>
<br>
Continue east up Little Cottonwood Canyon approximately 9 miles past the billboard to the eastern end of the Alta ski area.  The pavement ends at a well maintained dirt road, which can be followed approximately 3 miles to the Albion Basin Secret Lake trailhead.<br>
<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Approach via Secret Lake</h2> <div align="center" class="image-left" style="width: 206px;">

</div>
<br>
From the trailhead parking area follow the well maintained trail for approximately 3/4-mile to the east shore of Secret Lake.  This portion of the trail is very popular and sees heavy foot traffic, especially on early summer weekends when wildflowers are in full bloom.<br>
<br>
From the lake follow a faint hikers trail around the north side of the lake, and head for the Sugarloaf ski lift which can be seen a short distance to the west.<br>
<br>
Eventually you will intersect a service road which winds its way up to the top of the Sugarloaf ski lift.  Either follow the road or proceed directly up the slopes to the top of the lift.<br>
<br>
At the top of the lift you will be at a saddle with Sugarloaf Peak to the east and Mount Baldy to the west.<br>
<br>
From the saddle follow an unmaintained trail up the south-east ridge to the summit.  The ridge is steep at times but no scrambling is involved.<br>
<br>
Round Trip Hiking Distance: 4.0 miles<br>
Elevation Gain: 1,658 ft.<br>
Trailhead Elevation: 9,410 ft. <br>
Summit Elevation: 11,068 ft.<br>

<br>
There are no fees for entering Albion Basin or parking at the Secret Lake trailhead.<br>
<br>
The dirt road from the Alta ski area to the trailhead passes through areas of privately owned cabins and property.  Be respectful of the local property owners, and observe speed limits and parking restrictions - park only in designated areas.<br>
