Nic Risser and I climbed the N Buttress of Mt Goode (III, 5.9+) car-to-car. We drove through the night and immediately left the trailhead at 3:30 am, reaching the base of the route at 5:30 am. We ate breakfast and enjoyed the alpenglow as the sun rose and warmed the rock. We started P1 at 7:30 and topped out about 3pm. The route was great! While there was some loose rock, it was no worse than Temple Crag. The route gave us everything from face climbing to wild mantels &amp; stems, finger to fist cracks, OW &amp; chimneys. The 5.9 pitches were stout, and the traversing pitch was runout. There was a fast team from Bishop that was also on the route behind us. It was a busy day on Goode!

The approach was very easy and straightforward. The trail was over before we knew it, and even in the dark the cross country section fell together very well. Even the talus section was short and the rocks stacked fairly solidly. After 2 hours of moderate effort we were at the base.

The snow was hard packed, but just the right consistency to need nothing more than approach shoes. We made short work hiking up the snow and traversing a cl. 2 ledge on the cl. 4 slab (perhaps the snow height determines the difficulty?). By 7:30 we were starting the first pitch.

<br>

You could put smaller pro pieces in the little crack to the right, but if you're linking this with P1, as I was, you'll have used your smaller gear on P1 and have your larger gear left over. Also, the crack was easy enough to leapfrog pieces if you didn't want to run it out. I only used 2 pieces in the crack but never felt insecure moving the cams between jams.

The pitch ends on sloping slabs with very few opportunities for pro. I climbed up and right, and then back down and left on a higher ledge before belaying Nic up.

Nic passed below me and traversed over to a very hollow looking flake. This may have been a better belay spot, but I didn't like the idea of building an anchor in that flake!

Nic spent a lonnnng time leading this pitch. Since he regularly leads 5.10 face climbs, this did not bode well for me having a nice time following the traverse. Eventually rope drag stopped him short, at the regular belay (we had hoped to link the next 2 pitches), and after an hour of effort, it was my turn to get scared.

<b><i>Exposure at the P3 face traverse crux.</i></b>
</center>
<br>
<br>

At first the face climbing was just exposed, but not too bad. Then I got to the knifeblade piton and couldn't find enough features to use to get to the second corner. I hesitated to unclip the piton, as I was worried about taking a swing into the unknown around the corner, but I wasn't sure if I could reach back to unclip it. I climbed up, climbed down, and eventually decided I could backclean. A few delicate smears and I grabbed the edge, reached back and unclipped the piton, then swing back around the corner and onto a narrow ledge.
<br>
<br>

It was good I did the crux this way! I had to climb another 15 ft or so on a narrow ledge and down into the chimmney, where the next piece of pro was - a slung chockstone. If the follower unclips the piton and falls, they would take about a 15-20 ft blind pendulum around the corner and splatter into the 5.9 face climb to the left of the chimney. This face had sparse pro (Nic made good use of the C3 cams), and was only slightly easier than the crux. Nic had to wander all over the face to find pro and find his way through, as the two didn't really coincide. After an hour of nervous following, I finally made it up to the belay ledge.

Since Nic hadn't linked the next pitch, he set off again. He is new to alpine climbing, so even though this pitch was easy, he climbed slowly and carefully as it had loose rock and I would be in the fall line of anything he knocked off.

<br>
<br>

I reached the notch and we had a leisurely lunch in the sunshine as we pondered the next pitch. I was a bit confused as to where I should go, as I saw three options for climbing through the roof. A direct attack looked best at first, since it was short and the angle eased off right after the roof.

<b><i>P5 5.9 crux follows the thin crack on the right using a combination of jams, sidepulls, and stems.</i></b>
</center>
<br>
<br>

I stemmed up below the roof and saw the center option to be more of a flaring, insecure crack, sort of OW-ish and probably not 5.9. The crack to the right was looking more appealing, although it was steep, often too thin to jam or often flaring, and leaned at a funny angle. However, it was barely close enough to do a wide and delicate stem from crack to corner, and it took small pro in sections where you couldn't jam anyways.

The chimney wasn't too hard and barely required any chimneying technique. There are plenty of face features to use throughout. Leading with a pack, however, required some lack of shame in awkwardly grinding my way up the slot.

We had rough plans to meet some friends at the summit, whom we had left sleeping in the car at the TH. So we took our time and enjoyed the views and chatted with the climbers in the party behind us.

We hung around an hour or so before heading down one of the nicest descends in the Sierra - a little bit of cl. 3 boulder downclimbing, and then sandy slopes galore straight down to the trail! Another highlight is that you are rewarded with some nice views of the ridge you had just climbed as you hike out.

As we hiked out, our sleep deprivation kicked in, hitting us like a wall. We wandered down in a surreal dizzying daze. Our three friends were already back at the car, so we hopped in and headed to the Mammoth hot springs for a perfect ending of a perfect day. Tomorrow we would all <a href="http://www.markpthomas.com/mountaineering/trip-reports/california/laurel-mtn-ne-gully-e-ridge"> climb the NE Gully of Laurel Mountain</a> together to round off the weekend.
