description: This is the most obvious sector in the 'Pratt's Crack Gulley'.  Look for the two giant dihedrals of immaculate white granite side-by-side, jutting out into the canyon.  Each corner and arete offers classics of varying styles.   
getting_there: You really shouldn't have any trouble finding this area as it is visible from the road.  Left side of the canyon, just past the 'Ministry Wall'.
