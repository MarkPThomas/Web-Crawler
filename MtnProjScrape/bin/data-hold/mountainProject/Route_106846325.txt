route_description: A classic route on the Northwest side of Mount Rainier. The route itself ascends more of what I would describe as a terraced buttress and ledges than an actual ridge, regardless, Ptarmigan Ridge offers fantastic position and interesting and often varied climbing. Consider the enjoyable approach to a scenic highcamp that you often have all to yourself and it makes Ptarmigan a worthwhile objective for any experienced and fit climber. The route consists of snow climbing(40-55 degrees) and often several sections of mixed rock/snow/ice. The route is steeper and more sustained than it's classic neighbor Liberty Ridge and requires almost 1000 feet greater elevation gain on summit day due to a start at 9,800ft on Mowich Glacier versus Liberty Ridge's 10,700ft start from Thumb Rock.   From 10K highcamp downclimb loose rock or steep snow a few hundred feet onto the Mowich Glacier. Crossing the Bergschrund is typically accomplished by finding a bridge just left of a rock outcropping about center of the face but an end-run may be necessary if the schrund cannot be passed in this area. You can easily view the condition of the shcrund from highcamp on the ridge. Once above the schrund climb 40-45 degree snow for about 1000ft until just below large rock cliffs where you make a traverse left into an hourglass shaped snow face below the large rock buttress that splits the upper route. Climb 45-55 degree snow to base of rock buttress at 11,500ft. There are two possible variations to the route that ascend from this point at the base of the buttress. (1) The original ascent traverses left onto exposed snow slopes then contours around  and up onto Liberty Cap and climbs between the rock buttress on right and the icefall on left(45-55 degrees, often icy) it then ascends towards summit as described below.  (2) The 1966 variation traverses right and up from the base of the rock buttress. Depending on conditions this section may be good styrofoam snow or verglassed rock or water ice or a combination of all. After several hundred feet of climbing you will move out onto the very left margin of the Mowich Face. Continue a rising traverse to the second rock gully encountered. One or two pins may be present in this short vertical rock step. Easier scrambling above this  leads to the Liberty Cap Glacier. From here follow moderate terrain to Liberty Cap where one must descend a few hundred feet then climb back up several hundred feet to reach the 14,410ft summit of Columbia Crest. Recommend descent via Emmons Glacier route. Once on route few bivy sites exist until you exit the rock gully onto the lower Liberty Cap Glacier. There are excellent bivy sites higher near Liberty Cap and Columbia Crest. Although the route can and sometimes is completed from highcamp along with the descent to White River without a bivy it makes for a very long day. A summit bivy adds a great finish to the days climbing and allows for a rested descent the next morning down the Emmons and the exit hike to White River.
