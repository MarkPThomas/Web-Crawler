route_description: Great moderate climbing with increasingly beautiful views of the valley.  Pitch 1 - (5.6) This is the crux of the route. Jam and stem up a right facing dihedral to belay at a tree above. Move the belay up and across 3rd class for forty feet to the base of a wide crack. (120')  Pitch 2 - (5.5) Climb the wide crack to the top of a pedestal and then continue slanting right across 5.4 territory to an alcove. (180')  Pitch 3 - (5.3) Slab climb up a knobby face to a large ledge. (120')  Pitch 4 - (5.5) Climb up the face to a right facing flake then either climb to the large roof and move right under the roof, or move right into a crack and avoid the roof entirely. Belay at a small tree.  Pitch 5 - (5.6) Climb up the crack and onto the face to the top of the buttress.  Descend by walking off into the gully on the left.
