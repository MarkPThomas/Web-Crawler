route_description: Nice right leaning crack, 3 feet right of the Narcolepsy arete.    Finally got around to doing this route, albeit only on TR.  Definitely worth doing while in the Narcolepsy area!  Sort of soft for a 10a, but a respectable lead requiring some small gear near the top with ledgefall potential.  First 2/3 is excellent, but the rock quality degrades slightly at the finish.
