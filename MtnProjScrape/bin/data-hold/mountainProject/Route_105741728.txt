route_description: This is the left of the two cracks, left of the Narcolepsy/Dreamscape face.  An easy beginning leads to an awkward steeper section that gets more difficult as soon as Mr. Sandman branches right.  A couple of cruxes, IMO, the first clearing the 1st overhanging section and the second on the exit sequence, will test your confidence.  A nice climb worth doing with some fun jamming and a bit of chimneying.
