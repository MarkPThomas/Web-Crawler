getting_there: Estes Park is the gateway community to the eastern side of Rocky Mountain National Park.  This small town can be reached from Denver via US 36 through Boulder & Lyons with an hour plus drive.  You can access it from further N of Denver (like Ft. Collins) via US 34.  You can access it from the S via the winding CO 7 (Peak to Peak Hwy) from communities like Nederland & Allenspark.  Finally, you can access it from the W on US 34 (aka Trail Ridge Rd) during summer months.  Once in town, the hillside N of town is the classic Lumpy Ridge.  Other various crags can be accessed via smaller roads described in the specific areas.  Map of Estes Park
