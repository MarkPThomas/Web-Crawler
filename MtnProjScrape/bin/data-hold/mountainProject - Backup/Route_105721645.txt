route_description: I never have figured out quite how to pronounce the name of this climb.  I also have no idea what the hell a buissonier is.  A buisson is a bush.  The nearest I can figure is buissonniere, French for "to play truant or skip school".  In any case, a pretty good climb.  Begin behind campsite (#21).  First moves off the deck are awkward - protect with small nut or TCU to avoid castration from sharp fin of rock below in the event of a fall.  Either jam or lieback the left-angling crack.  Gear belay.  Descent: scramble down chimney to the southwest (a little tricky).
