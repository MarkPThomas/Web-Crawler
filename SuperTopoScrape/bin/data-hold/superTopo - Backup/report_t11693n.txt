<b><u>The Carryover Idea</u></b><br>
<br>
With careful reading of guidebooks and time spent farting around on Google Earth, I had pieced together several multi-day traverse ideas around the Grand Teton that could allow us to minimize the effort needed to link up various climbs in the area in one trip. The largest linkup I had dreamed up was to traverse from our base camp at the Lower Saddle over to Valhalla Canyon. There we could gain the Grandstand via the classic Serendipity Arete on Mt. Owen and a traverse from that summit (although one could directly climb the Grandstand from Valhalla Canyon). The Grandstand would serve as our launching point for climbing our main objective of the carryover - the North Ridge of the Grand Teton, from which we could then return to our remaining gear cache at the Lower Saddle.<br>
<br>
The Valhalla Traverse was the key to us achieving this ambitious linkup as we could make a complete loop from the Lower Saddle without any need to hike back out. It was a wonderful idea, but it was also ambitious. We had originally planned to do the Valhalla Traverse the same day as the Complete Exum Ridge (the guidebook said we only needed 3-4 hrs to do the traverse), then climb Serendipity Arete to the Grandstand in a long day, and then finish climbing over the North Ridge. This would mean we would spend 2.5 days and 2 nights doing the linkup.<br>
<br>
However, conditions on the Exum slowed us up enough that we decided not to tempt fate with the Valhalla Traverse that day, so we left an entire day for it, on the worst weather day forecast for our trip. Since I was wary about any additional weather slowing us up, we decided to pack for 4 full days and 3 nights' worth of food and fuel just in case we were delayed a day. It was good we did this, since the storms on our first day, combined with the cold and windy weather on the days after made us take 4 days to do the linkup instead of 2.5!<br>
<br>
For the record, it took us about 3 hours to do the traverse from the Lower Saddle to the West Gunsight Couloir. This traverse might be done faster with lighter packs, though it often might be slower as there is normally more snow and ice on the route. The Teton NPS maintains a good <a href="http://tetonclimbingroutes.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">web blog</a> on route conditions in the area, and they often include conditions on this traverse.<br>

Steph and I woke early the next day, with gear packed for the multi-day carryover and the extra food, fuel, and luxuries packed separately to be left at the Lower Saddle as a cache. There was a food storage box that was convenient for this, to keep our gear dry and safe from varmints.<br>

Unfortunately we were also casual on following directions and thought we were supposed to aim much lower on the ridge on the horizon. We descended about 200 ft from the Lower Saddle before realizing that we should have ascended halfway to the Black Dike, and ultimately reach the skyline at approximately the same altitude at a large cairn visible from the Exum huts.<br>
<br>
Doh!<br>
<br>
We slogged back up the hill, angling for the top of the red rock rib that is the first feature on the traverse. We seemed to be making a habit out of starting off route each day . . .<br>
<br>
We rounded the top of the red rock rib, and descended a chute of loose, red rock for about 200 ft before cutting across some little ridgelets. Occasionally there were cairns along the way to mark the route.<br>

We traversed a long, broad, easy slope that usually holds snow for most of the year. By now it was completely melted out and made for easy class 2 travel. Since snow often persists late into the year on this traverse, there are bivy sites near the Northwest Ridge of the Enclosure where climbers can gather snow for water and get a head start on any of the routes climbing up the Enclosure.<br>

Unfortunately, we found a lot of trash at this nice bivy site. At least the climbers packed it all into a few bags and pinched it down in the rocks, but it still seemed very irresponsible. If you are strong enough to do climbs back here, you are strong enough to carry out your GU wrappers! We took some trash but there was too much for us to reasonably pack out.<br>

From here the route ascends a short class 2-3 step as it rounds the corner and narrows. The ledge gets much narrower, but is still an easy class 2 ledge that wraps around one more ridgelet before the final traverse and descent into Valhalla Canyon.

The late season description was spot on for us. As we descended into the bowl, we encountered a sad-mud-rock slurry that was a distinct yellow color and seemed very similar to wet cement. As Steph is a veteran of many loose North Cascade adventures, she was less apprehensive than me about descending into this steep exposed bowl. Where the terrain was too loose to downclimb without slipping, she just sat down to slow down and stabilize her sliding. It was a strange technique of half sliding on one's butt while also somewhat downclimbing with one's arms and legs.<br>

Eventually the ramp became quite serious as it narrowed to just a few feet on a sloping ramp-slot that seemed as if it would dump the unwary climber off the precipice to the side. This slab was covered with sand, scree, and fractured rock. Looking ahead I could see that there might be potential for some pro. At the very least I could see where a gear anchor could be made to belay the follower in to limit the consequences of falling on this crux. There was no anchor at our position, but there was a solid rock shaped well to be slung, so I slung the block and put Steph on belay. She downclimbed this slot (class 4?), placing a few solid pieces as she went. Although the guidebooks said "belay anchors and protection are nearly impossible to obtain", at least we were able to do so at the crux! I can only imagine how this slot would be when covered in ice and chock full of snow.<br>

Below the slot the ledge stayed quite steep, but at least it widened such that a fall would send one down the ramp instead of off of it. Ahead we could see the remnant of the snowfield that always requires some gear to cross. We had brought crampons and ice tools on the carryover specifically for this section.<br>

Once we reached the snow field remains, we could see that what remained was a sliver of ice about 10 feet across and about 50 degrees steep. The terrain we were on was also very steep and composed of loose rock and dirt. It seemed like it would be a major pain to put on crampons here for such a short crossing.<br>

<br>
I thought maybe we could just chop a few steps to quickly walk across and be done with the crossing. However, the ice was hard enough and the position awkward enough that it was difficult to chop steps very efficiently. Steph started looking for a way to climb the steeper rock above to where we could possibly just step over the ice. I expressed my doubts about going that way without being roped up, as it looked to be 4th class on extremely loose rock and we were already in steep terrain where falling would be very bad.<br>
<br>
As I was expressing my doubts about Steph's strategy, a table-sized block of ice came tumbling down the narrow strip of ice! Well, after seeing that I agreed that it would be a bad idea to try the slow process of chopping steps. It also probably wouldn't be a good idea to rope up here, as stretching a rope across the debris chute now seemed like a bad idea.<br>
<br>
Fortunately Steph found a way up that was reasonably solid if you were careful, and she was able to quickly step across the ice and run across the gully before stopping and waiting beneath the cover of the next set of tiered cliffs. I carefully climbed up and into position, during which time another large block of ice came falling down. Once I was in position, I stopped and listened to make sure nothing was coming down, and quickly stepped across and ran over to Steph as fast as I could.<br>
<br>
That guidebook certainly put the conditions of this traverse mildly! Steph said she had been through worse, but that this traverse was still noteworthy in her experience. I sure was glad to be done with it and hope that I don't have to repeat it!<br>

The West Couloir of Gunsight Notch turned out to have snow and running water even this late in the year after a dry winter. We took note of this, and I traversed across and up towards Serendipity Arete to look for a bivy while Steph investigated a line closer to the water source. We both found excellent bivies, and decided that the ones Steph found were on the West Ledges route and mine was more along the Serendipity Arete route.<br>

Steph was about to go get water next, but as the swirling clouds were starting to look more ominous, I suggested we get the tent set up first just in case it rained. No sooner had I said that than it began to rain. We hurriedly put up the tent as the intensity increased, and hopped inside to take cover. The rain came down hard enough that is started to soak through the membrane of the First Light tent. Hmmm . . .<br>

Some minutes later the storm had passed and the sun was back out again. It seemed like we had lucked out with perfect timing on finishing the Valhalla Traverse!

Fortunately, while it looked like a bad day to be up high, it was warm and sunny at camp (for the moment).<br>

This second storm was stronger than the first one. First the rain came hard and started to soak through the tent membrane again as the wind buffeted the tent and lightning struck the peaks above. Then the rain changed to hail, which hammered the walls of the tent, sending water spraying all over the interior of the tent. It was a good thing that we had left our down sleeping bags packed away! Seeing this potential problem, I was glad that I had a bivy sack liner for my bag. Steph and I decided that she could probably get some protection for her bag by spreading my rain poncho over it, and keeping it packed away until we were ready for bed.<br>

So the sun came back out again, and so did we! We laid gear back out to dry, and enjoyed our picturesque campsite, reading, relaxing, doing logic puzzles, and of course photography! One ongoing thing I was amused to find on this trip was that I was often taking photographs in Steph's direction as she was taking photographs, usually in my direction. It was rather funny to be inadvertently be playing a game of camera tag. This phenomenon kept occurring throughout the trip as we both seemed to be in sync with our oddly obsessive photo-taking habits.<br>

This day I took Steph up on her offer to try out one of her logic puzzles. While I still think I'd want a book for some breaks, I found her puzzles to be very fun and engaging, and the size-to-time entertainment ratio of these little games printed out on paper trounced that of books. I'll have to remember to bring some of these along in the future on climbs in lieu of books (or at least bring less reading material).<br>

Some more storms rolled through off and on, and we moved out lounging out of the tent and back inside several times. Meanwhile I was concerned about the weather for the coming days, but Steph was insistent that the latest forecast she saw said this should pass and the rest of the time for our carryover should have stable weather.
