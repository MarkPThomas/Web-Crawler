description: These two immense formations at the western edge of the Wonderland Valley absolutely dominate the entire region and are visible from afar as easily recognizable landmarks.   One of the most popular destinations in the Wonderland, The Astro Domes hold an amazing collection of high quality routes on mostly excellent quality stone. Routes here range from 5.1 to 5.13 with single, two, three and even four pitch routes to challenge both body and mind. Climbing here is altogether different experience that will challenge your notions of Joshua Tree as nothing more than grainy slabs with it's soaring flake systems and intricate face climbing up steep thin crimps and edges.   South Astro Dome  has many stellar routes including Breakfast of Champions (5.8+), Solid Gold (5.10a), Piggle Pugg (5.10c), Such a Savage (5.11a R), Middle Age Crazy (5.11c/d), Stone Idol (5.12a R), Middle Age Savage (5.12a/b) and Mamunia (5.13a).   North Astro Dome  has it's share of quality routes as well - Figures on a Landscape (aka Monkey on My Back) (5.10b R), Astroturf (5.10d), Unknown Soldier (5.11b), Repo Man (aka Power Fingers) (5.12a R) and the Gunslinger (5.12a/b).  
getting_there: Park at the Uncle Willie's dirt lot and follow an old road east to a fork in the road and then make a left, bearing north, towards an old pink building (Uncle Willie's Health Food Store).    Head left into a wash and some trees and follow the wash as it curves left (west) and then just past an old retaining wall/dam makes a right heading north. Continue along the wash/trail as it meanders between formations forming a narrow valley. After 0.5 miles or so and just past Foolproof Tower you'll reach the southern end of the expansive Wonderland Valley where the impressive Astro Domes will come into view.  Shortly after entering the vally the trail will fork - take the left fork heading west. A bit of scrambling through some rocks will gain level ground near the base of the massive Don Juan Boulder. Circle around the north side of the boulder heading towards the South Astro Dome aiming for the left of two gold streaks on the face and follow slabs uphill that parallel the base of the dome.   The North Astro Dome is reached by continuing along the base of the South Astro Dome and then down a bit of rocky terrain to the base. The approach usually takes between 30-45 minutes assuming no routefinding errors are made.
