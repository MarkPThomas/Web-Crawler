route_description: West Arete is an obscure backcountry Sierra route that deserves more traffic. It takes its path up one of the most complex and intimidating mountain faces in the range, the west/southwest side of Mt. Winchell. Climbing this route is a considerable commitment and a great adventure for an experienced party. Despite it's Grade III, 5.8 rating and understated description of difficulties listed in a popular guidebook, we found 4th-5th class approach, incredible exposure, steep terrain, and eleven long (150+ feet) and mostly sustained pitches, only a couple of which were easier than 5.7. Most of the pitches included at least one 5.7+ section while two stretches felt like 5.9. Hence, this route is not recommended for 5.8 trad leaders. Falling and getting injured on this route will present a major rescue challenge. So, don't fall!  This route (or one of its flavors) was first climbed by prolific Galen Rowell and Warren Harding in May 1976. It features mostly clean rock and varied climbing: steep face moves on positive holds, pumpy liebacks, jamming, stemming, knife edge ridge traversing and chimneys. It maintains its sustained nature throughout and ends on the northwest ridge of the mountain approximately 100' below the pointy summit. Protection is good: lots of nut-eating cracks and opportunities for smaller cams. Belay stations are usually comfortable. It's most striking characteristic, which, in my opinion, makes it classic, is that it unravels in front of you as you progress. Once you gain the arete, just follow the path of least resistance.  Instead of giving a detailed pitch by pitch description, I'd list route highlights and give pointers that will help to climb the route while maintaining its adventurous nature.  Once you rope up, go up and left through flakes and crack systems. First two pitches will feature stretches of 5.8 and 5.9 climbing. We found the crux to be on the 2nd pitch where you have to lieback a finger crack up a steep face and stem on insignificant footholds for approximately 20 feet. At first, it will not seem that you're climbing on an arete. However, after the second pitch, this will change. Eventually, you will find yourself tip-toeing on a knife edge and walking on a foot-wide ridge (not recommended for people with vertigo problems). One particular section of the ridge is so sharp, you have to crawl past it on all fours. Approximately half way up, there is a steep and intimidating gendarme. It may be possible to bypass it on the right (we didn't try) or climb on its left side up a very steep face (scary!) with sloping holds and thin cracks. Exposure here is tremendous. As you near the top of the gendarme, there will be a committing move above pro that goes at 5.8+. Past this move, you will regain the ridge proper for easier climbing. Don't forget to occasionally look around and enjoy this outrageous place. On the upper half of the route, it should be easier to bypass certain difficulties on the right side of the arete. When the southwest chute (to your right) comes to its end below the summit headwall, look for a near-vertical chimney/crack system on the right side of the arete. It will place you near the intersection of West Arete and Northwest Ridge. Continue up and right Northwest Ridge for a couple more pitches until the summit.
