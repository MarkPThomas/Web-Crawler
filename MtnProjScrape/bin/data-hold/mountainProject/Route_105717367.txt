route_description: Route starts at the top of the trail from the parking lot to Supercrack Buttress.  Follows the obvious chalked hand crack in a corner through a large overhang.  Lieback up the corner to the roof.  Jam out the roof with perfect hands (crux) to a great rest at the end (#3 Camalot).  Finish up the corner to a bolt anchor at 95 feet.  It really is incredible!  Get there early because lines will form on the weekends.
