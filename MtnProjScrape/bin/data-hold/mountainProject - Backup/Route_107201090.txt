route_description: 1st Pitch: Great laybacking pitch, gets greasy/slick higher up, with interesting moves to exit onto the ledges. Sustained. (10d)(120ft)  2nd Pitch: Off width pitch, doesn't seem to get as much traffic? (10a)(130ft)  The first (money) pitch can also be top-roped after leading Hari-kiri (10a) as they share anchors
