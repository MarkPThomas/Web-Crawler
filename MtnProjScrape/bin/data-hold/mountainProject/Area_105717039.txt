description: This is a big wall that is off to the left just past the Courthouse Wash Bridge.  The wall looks really smooth but has a series of three blocks leaning against it at one point - this is Chinese Eyes. 
getting_there: Park at the pullout on the left immediately past the Courthouse Wash Bridge.  Find a climbers trail/wash that heads NW towards big blocks leaning against the wall.  About 5 minutes hiking time.
