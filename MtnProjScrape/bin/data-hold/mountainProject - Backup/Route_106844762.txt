route_description: Just left of the 5.8 alcove boulder problem there is a flaring crack that is a mix of face/lb/jam. The crux is the first set of moves and climbing gets easier the higher you get. This is a decent lead although short and can be toproped with the tree if you scramble up the easier terrain. If leading take 1-4.5" pro For the bottom and extra long runners for the topanchor.
