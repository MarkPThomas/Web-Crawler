description: These crags are all along Donner Pass Road near Donner Pass itself, in the Old Highway 40 section of John Jackson's North Tahoe guidebook. 
getting_there: Drive on Interstate 80 from outside the Donner area.  From the west, take exit 174 at Soda Springs, and follow Donner Pass Road just past the ski areas where large rocks appear on both sides of the road.  From the east, take exit 184 just past Truckee for Donner Pass Road. Drive past the lake, and up to your destination.  Where to park:  For crags at the top of Donner Pass Road, or along the Pacific Crest Trail, your best bet park off the pavement on the shoulders of dirt service roads behind Sugar Bowl Academy, and walk down from there. In season you'll see PCT through hikers passing through. Occasionally you'll be able to park right at School Rock, too, but these convenient spots fill up first.
