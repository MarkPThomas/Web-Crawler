route_description: This climb is up and right of "Pot Belly". The best approach is to climb "Pot Belly" first pitch, or go up a gully to the right. Walk right, to the base. Follow a crack to a flake, then up knobby rock to a belay at a tree, with rap slings. Either rappel or climb a flake and more knobs to the top.
