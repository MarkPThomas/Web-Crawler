area_name: Sierra Eastside Rock Climbing  
area_url: /v/sierra-eastside/105798288 
description: Where the high desert meets the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada.  It's home to the mighty and expansive Owens Valley, the deepest in the lower 48, and one of the only known super volcanoes on the planet:  The Long Valley Caldera, just south of Mammoth.  The vistas are astounding, the weather is prime and the climbing is even better.  The Eastside offers an almost incomprehensible amount of clean, climbable rock, including sport climbing at Owens River Gorge and Clark Canyon, bouldering in the Buttermilks and Happy Boulders, and alpine climbing on 14,000' granite peaks.  On rest days, soak your sore muscles and relax in the numerous natural hot springs... could this be paradise??     	  	              	      	  	    Mt. Williamson (14,389 ft.) rising over 10,000 feet from the valley floor   	 
getting_there: From Los Angeles, head north on Hwy 14 through the desert towns of Palmdale, Lancaster, and Mojave to join Hwy 395.  The scenic 395 parallels the eastern Sierra through the Owens Valley from the L.A. basin to Reno.  Lone Pine is the first "major" town (pop. 1,655) en route, and is the jumping off point for Mt. Whitney and other popular destinations in the John Muir Wilderness (see High Sierra section).  60 miles north is the town of Bishop (pop. 3,575).  Bishop was home of the late, renowned climber/photographer Galen Rowell, who, along with his wife Barbara, was killed August 11, 2002 in a small plane crash outside town.  Rowell's gallery, the Mountain Light, is located at 106 South Main Street in downtown Bishop.    	  	              	      	  	    First winter snows on Bear Creek Spire at sunrise
