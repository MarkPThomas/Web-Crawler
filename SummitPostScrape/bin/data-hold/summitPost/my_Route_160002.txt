</table></noformat><a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Route Description</h2>1. Scramble up the rocky ridgeline along cliffbands above Gunsight Pass <br>
2. Sramble up a ridgeline that originates above Dollar Lake. This approach is also common for Gilbert Peak. <br>
3. Scramble up a gulley that is located above the last thick patch of trees on the north side of the canyon (ca. 11,400ft), just after the junction with the pack trail. This route is the most likely to have a snowfield in late summer, which can be very convenient for refilling water.<br>
<br>
Routes 2 and 3 terminate at the edge of a broad, relatively flat tundra expanse. From there, just head southwest towards the peak!  Gilbert Peak is to the southeast, and many people do that and Gunsight Peak in one climb.<br>
<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Essential Gear</h2>Crampons and ice axe may be necessary during snowy conditions.  Avalanche safety gear would also be recommended.<br>
<a name="chapter_4"></a><h2>Miscellaneous Info</h2>If you have information about this route that doesn't pertain to any of the other sections, please add it here.<br>
