area_name: Waterfront, The Rock Climbing  
area_url: /v/waterfront-the/105739697 
description: Just west of Kermit's Wall/Perhaps Area is another section of cliffs called The Waterfront.  Home to black streaked rock galore, The Waterfront boasts several bolted slab routes along with steep and difficult cracks.  Not nearly as popular as Green A area's, The Waterfront is a nice locale to beat the crowds. 
getting_there: Park as for the Gate Buttress, and hike past the Tower Boulder. Continue through the talus field, angling up and west.  Look for cairns as they are present.  After the talus field ends, find the soft trail through the trees and bushes to the base of the Waterfront.
