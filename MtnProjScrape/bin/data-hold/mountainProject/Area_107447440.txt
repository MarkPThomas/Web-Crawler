description: Northern Arizona (NAZ) is a vast and varied landscape of rolling ponderosa forests, high elevation plains, and sculpted sandstone deserts. Home to the Grand Canyon, the Painted Desert, the Mogollon Rim, the San Francisco Peaks, and some of the best whitewater on the Colorado River, Northern Arizona is quite literally a sacred land to the Navajo and Hopi, as well as many a rock climber....   Climbing in Northern Arizona began in the late 1950's with the first ascent of the Mace in Sedona, done by visiting climbers, Bob Kamps, TM Herbert, and Dave Rearick.  In the years to follow many of the major formations and summits throughout Northern Arizona would be pioneered, and an age of vast exploration was set in motion.  As Tim Toula writes in his classic guide, A Cheap Way To Fly, "I entered thru the historical gate of the Flagstaff climbing scene in the fall of 1978 when climbing was still much more of an underground sport than it is today.  There was a mystique about climbing then that was hard to grasp.  Perhaps it was because there were so few climbers then.  Names like Baxter, Coats, Davidson, and later, Murray, Gault, and Mattson floated thru the air like phantoms.  Their names heard often, but their talents seldom seen". Check this book out for a more comprehensive slice of the early history of Northern Arizona climbing. At twenty some years old, this is still one of few sources for local areas.  Now a days that list of names has grown tremendously as a constant stream of talent pours out of Flagstaff, which is the heart of the Northern Arizona climbing scene. With all the development of the last couple decades, Flagstaff is now poised to start turning out some world class climbers. The age of exploration that began in the late 50's has not only continued to this day, but has blossomed into a collective energy that really defines the community here. There is always something new to check out, and hidden gems are still being discovered in surprising numbers.   Take a look at Joel Unema's, grassroutesclimbing.com/. for stories and photos about local areas, and interviews with local route developers. It's a cool project and will hopefully turn into a means to record and revel in the colorful history of Northern Arizona rock climbing.

Volunteer Canyon, AZ   	   Trad Climbing Northern Arizona has long been held as a bastion of traditional climbing, and for good reason.  With the sumptuous single pitch basalt crags like *Paradise Forks, The Overlook, *Volunteer Canyon, and *The Waterfall, Northern Arizona is a hard rock trad climber's dream with easily accessed four star routes.  Add to that the gritty, character building back country adventures of the Grand Canyon National Park, the mysterious quartzite Hualapai Wall, and the soft stone spire paradise, the *Sedona Area, you might just find yourself slipping into a heart pounding state of trad daddy nirvana.      	  	              	      	  	    Worth The Weight The Gold Wall, Paradise Forks  Arizona  Photo: blakemccordphoto.com   	   Sport Climbing If you are looking for sport routes in Northern Arizona, you won't have to look too hard. To the east lay crags like the Winslow Wall and *Jacks Canyon south of Winslow. Around Flagstaff you will find great crags like  The Pit, The Doctor's Office , the Mt. Elden areas Solitude Canyon and Red Dragon, as well as,  The Peaks Crag and the Hobo Jungle on the San Francisco peaks. Way up north are the unique limestone crags the Virgin River Gorge and the The Arizona Strip. Sport climbing is alive and well throughout Northern Arizona.  Whether you are looking for steep pockets, or off vertical crimps, the list of fine crags and excellent routes is sure to keep you happily swinging through the air, one way or another....

Flagstaff is world renown for it's pocketed limestone roofs at areas like Priest Draw, but these roofs are tucked away in folds all over Northern Arizona. And though the double digit lines keep adding up at places like the Hinterlands and Cherry Canyon, even the beginning boulderer is going to find a slew of premiere challenges at crags like Buffalo Park, Lake Mary Areas, and  Turkey Tanks. From the Fontainebleau like slopers of Kelly Canyon, to the sharp dacite crimps of  Gloria's,  Northern Arizona is a boulderer's paradise.

Please help us keep them that way.   We tend to take care of our crags, and most of the routes listed here have adequate anchors or other fixed hardware, if they have any at all. However, one may encounter a few old, rotting pins in places like Sedona and in the Grand Canyon. Much of the original hardware in Secret Canyon on Mt. Elden is old and suspect. Crags that see a lot of action like Jacks Canyon, The Winslow Wall, and The Pit also have aging fixed hardware that wasn't all that great to begin with. I believe an era of route maintenance with glue-in bolt replacement looms before us.  Many of the anchor systems on single pitch routes throughout Northern Arizona employ the "fixed carabiner" style anchor which is specifically set up for easy, safe lowering. If one of the two carabiners is worn past the point of common sense, please leave one of yours in place and take the old one home with you. They make great conversation pieces....   And while a lot of the routes listed here are well traveled, it can be said that Northern Arizona is full of adventurous climbing. Always check your holds, especially on the softer stone.

Sitting at 7000' it is tucked in between the Mogollon Rim to the south, and the San Francisco Peaks just north of town. Flagstaff is draped over historic Route 66, and has everything a visiting climber may need, including buffets and chain healthfood stores.  Cheap motels, and plenty of public land for free camping.  Groovy coffee houses, and late night entertainment downtown.   Rest days can be filled with excellent hiking and peak bagging, miles and miles of world class mountain biking, or deep and narrow Canyoneering adventures. Or just take it easy and wander about the historic downtown which is filled with gear shops, art galleries, brewpubs, and a few good restaurants.

Flagstaff also sees an average of 100" of snow a year.... Yes despite most folks impressions of Arizona, we represent the winter months quite well here in Northern Arizona. Good winter climbing can be had throughout Northern Arizona at the Arizona Strip crags way up north, as well as, The Pit and Higher Solitude Canyon right around Flagstaff, and Jacks Canyon to the east. Winter is also the season for Sedona climbing. If the cold has really set in many retreat to the Central Arizona crags.   Springtime is notoriously windy, and has been known to drive people mad! Especially in the high deserts. Luckily, this is really the only detracting element of the season. Otherwise it's prime time for crags like The Waterfall, Paradise Forks, The Overlook, The Red Dragon, Lower Solitude Canyon and many, many more as perfect temps can easily be chased down.  The summer months bring about an average high of 88 degrees during July. Then it's Monsoon Season to the rescue! Flagstaff itself receives an annual 21" of rain a year, and much of it comes during the Monsoons which are powerful storm systems. Monsoon Season typically lasts through September. Attractive areas this time of year include The Hobo Jungle, The Peaks Crag, West Elden, The Winslow Wall, and more.  And of course, our favorite season Fall, does not disappoint in Northern Arizona. With usually sunny, moderate temperature days, most of our premiere crags are in perfect conditions. Whether you are chasing around the fall colors on the San Francisco Peaks, or marveling at the otherworldly dryness of the desert crags, Fall in Northern Arizona should not be missed.

The often expansive or tight horizons makes it difficult to capture with a lens. However, these brave local photographers and videographers have been capturing the essence of these wild and untamable lands for years or even decades.
