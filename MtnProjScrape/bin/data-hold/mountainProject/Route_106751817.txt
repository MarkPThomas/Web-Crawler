route_description: Start by scrambling up to the start of the short finger/hand crack in the left facing corner, and follow this to a small ledge at the base of the 3-4" crack in the corner. I found getting established in the crack to be the crux.  Follow this to bolted anchors.  I was barely able to jam my fists in the small constrictions, and I have somewhat large fists.
