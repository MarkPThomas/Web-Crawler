Definitely be ready to use your aiders in pairs on this one. Also, my short reach forced me to snag a shallow finger pocket to stay upright in the top step just barely long enough to clip the last bolt.

We decided to try Bob's NE side route. The class 3 scramble up and to a belay ledge to the right went according to plan, but we never saw the 2" crack described. Seemingly protectable cracks turned out to be seams. Apart from one where I dug out grass & dirt with my pinkie to make a cam placement, I mostly had to run it out (45 foot runouts on the 1st pitch, which seemed about 5.4-5.5, and about a 100 ft runout on the 2nd cl. 4-low 5th pitch, on sketchy pro). There was a piton at the first belay though (70m from the belay ledge - it was fortunate we brought 1 70m double rope!). 

Not quite what we expected, but plenty fun! We also watched some big wall climbers on Liberty Cap from Nevada falls for about an hour, and 'bouldered' on the nice hand-fist crack, finger crack, and short fist crack at the lookout.

There was a helicopter MedEvac being conducted on the shoulder, so NPS rangers would not allow us to continue down beyond the base of the cables. As we waited a half hour or so for the pickup, we watched an afternoon thunderstorm barrel down on us. We weren't allowed to go down until the helicopter came and left, and by then it was lightly raining and lightning was almost upon us! (2 seconds or less between boom and flash). Since I was carrying a pack full of metal climbing gear, I had a good run down to the forest as a hail & lightning storm erupted around us.

September 20th, 2003 - Excellent climb.  While the approach was a pain, the climbing from the U-notch to the summit was very nice.  While Dirk was more adventurous than me by jumping over a gap on the ridge to gain the summit, I found a nice hole to wriggle through to get there.  

P.S.  If I had to spend a night on the summit of a 14er, North Palisade would definitely be the peak of choice - there are a maze of cracks in the summit big enough to crawl through for shelter, and there are plenty of goodies (such as sweaters) left in them from previous climbers.

Long story short, we got off route, climbed really dangerous loose rock (I dislodged a desk-sized one by hand-jamming it) and ended up on the summit at midnight, with recently refrozen snow making our descent to the east notch difficult without crampons. After a night of downclimbing around the snow and cliffs, we made it back to camp at 6am. All in all, we had been on the move for 20 hrs since leaving the trailhead!

Our group's speed was rather slow (still faster that the guided groups we got entagled within), so I had enough energy to sprint up the final slope to the summit after crossing the crater. That makes this the 2nd 14er where I've sprinted to the summit :-D

High winds and a late time (2pm) forced us to abandon our summit attempt here :_(We did this car-to-car, leaving at 1:05 am w/o any sleep from the night prior. The high winds made the descent much more grueling than the climb (TR coming soon), and we didn't get back to our car until 10:30 pm. 21:25 hrs on the trail, and I had been awake for 40 hrs!

I still don't understand why the official summit with the register is lower than two other nearby points that are higher. Also, from the valley it only looks like one gable - the rest of the ridge just rolls like a wave. Go figure  :-)

The ridgeline along the +13,000 ft peak before reaching the final slope is definitely class 3 (see my photos) unless one drops below it about one thousand feet and does a traverse on steep slopes!!

Road was closed from 8,200 ft, so it was a long approach! 100% snow cover began at 9,200ft.  26 miles round trip with a total of 7,400 ft of elevation gain! Did it 1/2 day in, full day to summit, 1/2 day out.  Quite tiring since I did the West Ridge of White Mountain the day before, and Roundtop 2 days before that!

message: so I couldn't pass off ticking off one of the routes listed in Croft's guidebook :-). Led the first and third pitch of the N Arete & simul-climbed to the summit. The first pitch really felt like 5.5 to me, and I almost climbed through the crux before placing my first piece of pro.

The crystal pitch is what makes this climb truly memorable, though the ridge traverse actually seemed like more fun than the climb to gain it!

Descended the S Ridge, taking a difficult line (cl. 4-5). Then I realized I left my sneakers on the summit, so I climbed up and down an easier line (cl. 3).

July 30th, 2004 - Ascended South Slope - descended North Cleft - I climbed this route on my way to the 2004 Sierra Challenge. Besides being a fun scramble and leg-stretcher, the summit provided great views of Mts Lyell and Maclure, our objective in 2 days. The descent down the north side was more interesting, but the loose rock also made it a little more dangerous.
