description:       The Bugaboo Provincial Park is one of the greatest alpine playgrounds in North America, and the world for that matter.  Imagine large granite spires of all shapes and sizes surrounded by beautiful glaciers and mountains as far as the eye can see and that's the Bugaboos.  All the rock is alpine granite and the quality on most routes is superb, even those which are not considered classics.  Routes range from a few hundred feet tall to a few thousand and offer anything from ridge scrambles and moderate free climbs to hard test pieces and multi-day big walls.                The climbing season is generally June to September with July and August having the best chance of good weather.  But be prepared for any kind of weather, it can storm at anytime and it snows every month of the year.  Temperatures can vary greatly depending on what side of a spire you're climbing on (North, South, East, West), if the sun's out or not, or if it's windy so plan accordingly.  An ice axe and crampons are mandatory to be safe especially later in the season when the glaciers can become a little more troublesome to negotiate due to melting.  Glacier travel skills are recommended for getting to and from most climbs unless you're staying near the campground.                There are several options for staying in the park when your visiting.  The most comfortable but also the most expensive is the Conrad Kain Hut which is managed by the Alpine Club of Canada and will cost you $25 a night (Canadian) per person as of 2013.  But provides you with a warm dry place to hang out in foul weather, a kitchen with running water and lights for late night reading.  Other more cost effective options are the campgrounds, with the Applebee campground being the most popular by far.  It will cost you $10 (Canadian) a night per person (pay at the Kain hut) and is basically a large area of somewhat flat rocks to place your tent on.  It does offer you a toilet, racks for hanging gear and food and great views which make the price seem more reasonable.   
getting_there: The Bugaboo Provincial Park is located in the Purcell range of  British Columbia, off of Highway 95.  To get to the Bugaboos travel 17 miles north of Radium Hotsprings or 48 miles south of Golden on Highway 95 depending on where your coming from to the really small town of Brisco.  Head west on a dirt road that has a sign for the park and goes past a lumber mill.  Follow the dirt road over the Columbia River and up into the mountains for 28.5 miles.  There are several turn offs along the road but there are signs at most of them for the Bugaboos otherwise just stay on the main road.    Once at the parking area there should be enough chicken wire, wood posts and rocks to protect your vehicle from rubber eating porcupines.  You'll see what I mean when you get there, don't take a chance.  The trailhead is at the west end of the parking lot and the next 3 miles to the Conrad Kain Hut are steep so pace yourself.  It's about .5 miles from the hut to the Applebee campground up more steep trail.  The new guide book "The Bugaboos" written by Chris Atkinson and Marc Piche has all the info you need for a great trip.
