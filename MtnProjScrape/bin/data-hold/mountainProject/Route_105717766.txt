route_description: This climb is left of Incredible Hand Crack.  Look for the first climb that has a small pillar at its base.  Above the pillar, the climb continues as a right-facing dihedral.  Not too far above the pillar is a small roof.  You'll see the rest.    Make sure you milk the rest a little more than half way up.  This climb is sustained.
