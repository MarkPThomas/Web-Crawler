<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Overview</h2>The Uinta Mountains are one of the few mountain ranges in North America that run east to west rather than north to south. Within the Uinta Mountains are about 2000 lakes, and some 900-1000 are full of trout. Along with the San Juans in Colorado, the Uintas have more contiguous area above timberline than any other area in the Continental United States. This is a beautiful area with many lakes, meadows, wildflowers, and some rugged peaks. Solitude is usually easy to come by once you leave the popular fishing holes behind. <br>
<br>
This peak is a frequently viewed, but seldom climbed summit. The peak forms part of the backdrop to Trial Lake. The mountain itself is divided into two halves by The Notch, which is the mountains namesake. The peak is easy to reach, but still almost always offers solitude. This is a very scenic area! <br>

<a name="chapter_2"></a><h2>Getting There</h2>There are two trailheads normally used for the climb.  <br>
<br>
<b>Crystal Lake Trailhead</b><br>
<br>
Crystal Lake is reached from the Trial Lake spur road off Highway 150 25.7 miles east and north of Kamas.  Follow the signs along the spur road to Crystal Lake.  The spur road is gravel and is good for all vehicles.  A sign marks the trailhead.<br>
<br>
<b>Bald Mountain Trailhead</b><br>
<br>
This signed trailhead is located off Highway 150 on the west side 29 miles east and north of Kamas, or 49 miles south of Evanston.<br>

<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Routes Overview</h2>
<a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1994/object_id/2171"><b>The Notch Lake Route</b></a> climbs the eastern (highest) half of Notch Mountain.  See the route page for details.  Briefly put:  From the Bald Mountain Trailhead, follow the trail west that is posted for Notch Lake.  Follow the trail to the lake.  The route then climbs climb cross-country through the benches to the southwest and climb up to the south ridge of the summit of Notch Mountain. The route then scrambles and up the steep ridge to a false summit. The highest peak can be reached by heading west along the ridge for .5 miles. <br>
<br>
<a href="http://www.summitpost.org/show/route_link.pl/route_id/1993/object_id/2171"><b>The Notch Route</b></a> can be used to climb either summit (east or west) of Notch Mountain.  See the route page for details.  Breifly put:  From the Crystal Lake Trailhead, the route follows the trail north that is posted for Wall Lake. Wall Lake is reached shortly after a junction with a spur trail coming from Trail Lake. From Wall Lake, the trail switchbacks up to tiny Hope Lake. From here the trail heads northwest to near Twin Lakes and climbs to The Notch, which is a 10,600 feet high pass. Either peak of Notch Mountain can be climbed from the pass. The west summit is 11,258 feet high and the east summit is 11,267 feet high. The east peak requires a very steep scramble, and route-finding around a few cliffs. The west summit involves steep route-finding and boulder-hopping, but is an easier ascent. <br>
