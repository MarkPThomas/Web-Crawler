route_description: Earth Angel is an awesome route that climbs what must be one of the largest sandstone towers in the United States.  The first two pitches are laden with loose rock, so use caution.  The last four pitches are four stars for climbing quality.  This is also one of the best summits in Sedona.  Pitch 1 - Walk to the right edge of the large starting platform.  Climb a short crack then wander up broken rock and ledges to a nice belay ledge next to the Chimney.  (5.7 ~120')  Watch for loose rock on this pitch.  Pitch 2 - Climb chimney off belay being mindful of loose rock.  Belay at nice ledge on left at the top of the chimney.  (5.7 ~180')  Pitch 3 - Step across chimney and climb off-width crack above.  Jam, stem, off-width, and face climb past one bolt (pitch crux) to the top of this excellent pitch.  Everytime this pitch starts to really become difficult a Red Rocks style face hold seemed to magically appear.  Belay from a huge ledge at the top of this pitch.  (5.10- ~150')  Pitch 4 - Climb the left side of a pillar up a hands to fingers crack.  Belay at the top of this pillar.  Some say this is the best pitch on the route.  The first asensionists tunneled behind/through the pillar and climbed the right side.   (5.9 ~100')  Pitch 5 - Traverse up and right to a finger crack that is not directly visible from the belay ledge.  Climb up this crack and then onto the face above past an old bolt and pin.  Once through the major difficulties trend up and right over large chickenheads to another huge ledge and belay.  (5.10- ~140')  This pitch carries some serious climbing above an old bolt and pin.  Send the best lead head and face climber up on this pitch.  Pitch 6 - There are many ways to climb the final pitch ranging from 5.7 to 5.10x.  The described way was our path of least resistance, but there are probably 5 or 6 different ways to climb this last pitch.  Climb a moderate crack system directly off the belay ledge until an easy traverse left leads to the tower's north face.  From here 5.6 face climbing takes you to one of the best summit's in Sedona.  Look for the first rap anchor on the far side of the summit.
