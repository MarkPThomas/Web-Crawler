route_description: This climb is a fun climb. While in the book as 2 pitches, I chose to run to the top, to the end of my 70M rope. This worked well for me, but perhaps someone can comment on the belay situation in detail if done in 2 pitches.   In the center of the Tuna and Chips wall there is a small tower with a crack/groove on each side. 'Tuna Cookies' is on the left and 'Waterstreak' is on the right. Walk up the left side and start Tuna Cookies.  Just left of the left side of this pillar, spot a bolt perhaps 10 meters up. Make your way to this bolt and continue beyond, passing another bolt and eventually reaching the top of the pillar and the groove above it. Continue climbing up the groove on easy moves to reach the summit of the right side of the Tuna and Chips Wall and belay.   To walk off, go back and to the right and scramble down (5.0).  Like Tuna and Chips, this is a fun line and will provide good climbing for a party competent to lead it.
