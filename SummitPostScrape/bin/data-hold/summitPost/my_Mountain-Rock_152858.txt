<a name="chapter_1"></a><h2 id="first_h2">Overview</h2>Mount Wolverine is a peak that is often overlooked in the area. From the road, it is hidden behind Mount Millicent, and from Catherine Lake, it doesn't look like much more than a giant mound, but this peak has a lot to offer. Besides having nice views of upper Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons, this peak can provide a good workout and is easily accessible from either canyon for hiking, snow climbing in its rugged cirque, or backcountry skiing. Mt Tuscarora shares many of the same qualities and is only a short jaunt away along the ridgeline.<br>

<a name="chapter_3"></a><h2>Red Tape</h2>None. Big Cottonwood Canyon and Little Cottonwood Canyon occasionally close due to avalanche dangers, but this is only during and immediately following some large snow storms. <br>
If you are approaching from Little Cottonwood Canyon, you can park free in the Alta Ski lot, which is about 2 miles from the trailhead. If you want to start at the trailhead, you must continue up the road to Albion Basin. This road is closed in the winter, and a small fee of (TBA) is required to drive up it.<br>
<a name="chapter_4"></a><h2>When To Climb</h2>This peak is best climbed as a snowclimb or backcountry ski climb in late winter to early spring. It is best hiked in the fall once daytime temperatures are lower. The Wolverine Cirqu could provide some interesting opportunities for some steep spring snowclimbs up the chutes that penetrate the cliffs.<br>
<br>
<a name="chapter_5"></a><h2>Camping</h2>There are many walk-in campgrounds in Big Cottonwood Canyon. Alternatively, free camping is permitted in the nearby Mt Olympus, Broads Fork Twin Peaks, or Lone Peak Wilderness areas as long as it is done at least 100 ft away from trails.<br>
