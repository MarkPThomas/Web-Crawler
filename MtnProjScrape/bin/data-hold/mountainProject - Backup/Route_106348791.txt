route_description: Trial by Fire is the obvious trough-looking crack splitting the slab on the way up to the start of Super Slide.  At nearly a full (old-school) ropelength, it provides a through introduction to the kind of grunty, meat-and-potatoes climbing that is so frequently encountered in the Valley.  As such, it is worth seeking out on its own, although a nondescript second pitch links it into Super Slide.  This would turn the latter from a casual romp into more of a half-day affair.  Most people will expend more calories getting up the deceptively low-angle groove of Trial By Fire than on the alleged 5.9 business of Super Slide.  Strong likelihood of seasonal wetness.
