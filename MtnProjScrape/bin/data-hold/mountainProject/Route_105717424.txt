route_description: Located approx. 80 feet right of IHC, this route is a slightly left-leaning splitter on the right wall of a dihedral.  It intersectes the corner crack about 30 feet from the bolt anchors.  It starts as tight hands, negotiates two awesome offwidth pods, pulls through some sustained wide hands, and meets the dihedral, which is good to tight hands.  A steller climb that goes on and on, you never want it to stop.
