route_description: The obvious squeeze chimney starting with a couple of face moves and handcrack, pulling into the bottom of the chimney (a little awkward), then straightforward easy knee and foot chimney, ending with a short bit of crack/face (crux) pulling out of the top of the chimney section. Tops out on a nice big ledge.
